Abstract: HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the human immune system and can lead to death without proper treatment. In collaboration with the WHO and Wits University, we study how to improve the efficiency of HIV testing with the goal of eventual deployment, directly supporting progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.3. While prior work has demonstrated the promise of intelligent algorithms for sequential, network-based HIV testing, existing approaches rely on assumptions that are impractical in our real-world implementations. Here, we study sequential testing on incrementally revealed disease networks and introduce Policy-Embedded Graph Expansion (PEGE), a novel framework that directly embeds a generative distribution over graph expansions into the decision-making policy rather than attempting explicit topological reconstruction. We further propose Dynamics-Driven Branching (DDB), a diffusion-based graph expansion model that supports decision making in PEGE and is designed for data-limited settings where forest structures arise naturally, as in our real-world referral process. Experiments on real HIV transmission networks show that the combined approach (PEGE + DDB) consistently outperforms existing baselines (e.g., 13% improvement in discounted reward and 9% more HIV detections with 25% of the population tested) and explore key tradeoffs that drive decision quality.

Abstract: We introduce a quantitative method to compare arbitrary pairs of graph centrality measures, based on the ordering of vertices induced by them. The proposed method is conceptually simple, mathematically elegant, and allows for a quantitative restatement of many conjectures that were previously cumbersome to formalize. Moreover, it produces an approximation scheme useful for network scientists. We explore some of these uses and formulate new conjectures that are of independent interest.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Community detection (CD) on signed networks is crucial for understanding how positive and negative relations jointly shape network structure. However, existing CD methods often yield inconsistent communities due to noisy or conflicting edge signs. In this paper, we propose ReCon, a model-agnostic post-processing framework that progressively refines community structures through four iterative steps: (1) structural refinement, (2) boundary refinement, (3) contrastive learning, and (4) clustering. Extensive experiments on eighteen synthetic and four real-world networks using four CD methods demonstrate that ReCon consistently enhances community detection accuracy, serving as an effective and easily integrable solution for reliable CD across diverse network properties.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social media platforms facilitate echo chambers through feedback loops between user preferences and recommendation algorithms. While algorithmic homogeneity is well-documented, the distinct evolutionary pathways driven by content-based versus link-based recommendations remain unclear. Using an extended dynamic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), we show that content-based algorithms--unlike their link-based counterparts--steer social networks toward a segregation-before-polarization (SbP) pathway. Along this trajectory, structural segregation precedes opinion divergence, accelerating individual isolation while delaying but ultimately intensifying collective polarization. Furthermore, we reveal a paradox in information sharing: Reposting increases the number of connections in the network, yet it simultaneously reinforces echo chambers because it amplifies small, latent opinion differences that would otherwise remain inconsequential. These findings suggest that mitigating polarization requires stage-dependent algorithmic interventions, shifting from content-centric to structure-centric strategies as networks evolve.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data science agents promise to accelerate discovery and insight-generation by turning data into executable analyses and findings. Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in semantic understanding, they often struggle to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability in complex decision-making tasks that demand rigorous logic. Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical decision support yet risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care. We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.

Abstract: The combination of multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new possibilities for medical classification. This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.

Abstract: Large language models can perform well on many isolated tasks, yet they continue to struggle on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems that require skills such as planning, state tracking, and long context processing. In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.

Abstract: Evaluating the clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity of automatically generated medical imaging reports remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.

Abstract: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In this work we develop a novel insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation. This combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures that have been implicated, respectively, in associative learning and path integration. We draw an analogy between the formal benchmark of the Habitat point-goal navigation task and the ability of insects to learn and refine visually guided paths around obstacles between a discovered food location and their nest. We demonstrate that the simple insect-inspired agent exhibits performance comparable to recent SOTA models at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Testing in a more realistic simulated environment shows the approach is robust to perturbations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning trajectory and predict performance on the next question. A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper argues that AI-assisted peer review should be verification-first rather than review-mimicking. We propose truth-coupling, i.e. how tightly venue scores track latent scientific truth, as the right objective for review tools. We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.

Abstract: Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

Abstract: Conversational user queries are increasingly challenging traditional e-commerce platforms, whose search systems are typically optimized for keyword-based queries. We present an LLM-based semantic search framework that effectively captures user intent from conversational queries by combining domain-specific embeddings with structured filters. To address the challenge of limited labeled data, we generate synthetic data using LLMs to guide the fine-tuning of two models: an embedding model that positions semantically similar products close together in the representation space, and a generative model for converting natural language queries into structured constraints. By combining similarity-based retrieval with constraint-based filtering, our framework achieves strong precision and recall across various settings compared to baseline approaches on a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Rapid financial innovation has been accompanied by a sharp increase in patenting activity, making timely and comprehensive prior-art discovery more difficult. This problem is especially evident in financial technologies, where innovations develop quickly, patent collections grow continuously, and citation recommendation systems must be updated as new applications arrive. Existing patent retrieval and citation recommendation methods typically rely on static indexes or periodic retraining, which limits their ability to operate effectively in such dynamic settings. In this study, we propose a real-time patent citation recommendation framework designed for large and fast-changing financial patent corpora. Using a dataset of 428,843 financial patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) between 2000 and 2024, we build a three-stage recommendation pipeline. The pipeline uses large language model (LLM) embeddings to represent the semantic content of patent abstracts, applies efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search to construct a manageable candidate set, and ranks candidates by semantic similarity to produce top-k citation recommendations. In addition to improving recommendation accuracy, the proposed framework directly addresses the dynamic nature of patent systems. By using an incremental indexing strategy based on hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, newly issued patents can be added without rebuilding the entire index. A rolling day-by-day update experiment shows that incremental updating improves recall while substantially reducing computational cost compared with rebuild-based indexing. The proposed method also consistently outperforms traditional text-based baselines and alternative nearest-neighbor retrieval approaches.

Abstract: Efficiently selecting relevant content from vast candidate pools is a critical challenge in modern recommender systems. Traditional methods, such as item-to-item collaborative filtering (CF) and two-tower models, often fall short in capturing the complex user-item interactions due to uniform truncation strategies and overdue user-item crossing. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Item-to-Item (PI2I), a novel two-stage retrieval framework that enhances the personalization capabilities of CF. In the first Indexer Building Stage (IBS), we optimize the retrieval pool by relaxing truncation thresholds to maximize Hit Rate, thereby temporarily retaining more items users might be interested in. In the second Personalized Retrieval Stage (PRS), we introduce an interactive scoring model to overcome the limitations of inner product calculations, allowing for richer modeling of intricate user-item interactions. Additionally, we construct negative samples based on the trigger-target (item-to-item) relationship, ensuring consistency between offline training and online inference. Offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PI2I outperforms traditional CF methods and rivals Two-Tower models. Deployed in the "Guess You Like" section on Taobao, PI2I achieved a 1.05% increase in online transaction rates. In addition, we have released a large-scale recommendation dataset collected from Taobao, containing 130 million real-world user interactions used in the experiments of this paper. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/PI2I/PI2I, which could serve as a valuable benchmark for the research community.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI as a primary information source presents a paradigm shift from traditional web search. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study quantifying the fundamental differences between the results returned by Google Search and leading generative AI services. We analyze multiple dimensions, demonstrating that AI-generated answers and web search results diverge significantly in their consulted source domains, the typology of these domains (e.g., earned media vs. owned, social), query intent and the freshness of the information provided. We then investigate the role of LLM pre-training as a key factor shaping these differences, analyzing how this intrinsic knowledge base interacts with and influences real-time web search when enabled. Our findings reveal the distinct mechanics of these two information ecosystems, leading to critical observations on the emergent field of Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and its contrast with traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

Abstract: User behavior modeling lies at the heart of personalized applications like recommender systems. With LLM-based agents, user preference representation has evolved from latent embeddings to semantic memory. While existing memory mechanisms show promise in textual dialogues, modeling non-textual behaviors remains challenging, as preferences must be inferred from implicit signals like clicks without ground truth supervision. Current approaches rely on a single unstructured summary, updated through simple overwriting. However, this is suboptimal: users exhibit multi-faceted interests that get conflated, preferences evolve yet naive overwriting causes forgetting, and sparse individual interactions necessitate collaborative signals. We present STEAM (\textit{\textbf{ST}ructured and \textbf{E}volving \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}emory}), a novel framework that reimagines how agent memory is organized and updated. STEAM decomposes preferences into atomic memory units, each capturing a distinct interest dimension with explicit links to observed behaviors. To exploit collaborative patterns, STEAM organizes similar memories across users into communities and generates prototype memories for signal propagation. The framework further incorporates adaptive evolution mechanisms, including consolidation for refining memories and formation for capturing emerging interests. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STEAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy, simulation fidelity, and diversity.

Abstract: Group recommender systems help users make collective choices but often lack transparency, leaving group members uncertain about why items are suggested. Existing explanation methods focus on individuals, offering limited support for groups where multiple preferences interact. In this paper, we propose a framework for group counterfactual explanations, which reveal how removing specific past interactions would change a group recommendation. We formalize this concept, introduce utility and fairness measures tailored to groups, and design heuristic algorithms, such as Pareto-based filtering and grow-and-prune strategies, for efficient explanation discovery. Experiments on MovieLens and Amazon datasets show clear trade-offs: low-cost methods produce larger, less fair explanations, while other approaches yield concise and balanced results at higher cost. Furthermore, the Pareto-filtering heuristic demonstrates significant efficiency improvements in sparse settings.

Abstract: Minors are at risk of myriad harms online, yet online dating romance scams are seldom considered one of them. While research of romance scams in Western countries finds victims to predominantly be middle-age, it is unknown if minors in geographic regions with cultural norms around teenage marriage are uniquely susceptible to online dating romance scams. We present an interview study with 16 victims of online dating romance scams in Iran who were minors when scammed. Findings show that, with westernized dating apps banned in Iran, scammers find teenage victims through messaging platforms tethered to local neighborhoods, offering relief for parental pressures around finding a marital partner and academic performance. Using threats, lies, and exploitation of emotional attachment lacking from their families, scammers pressured minors into financial and sexual favors. The study demonstrates how local cultural context should be foregrounded in future research on, and solutions for, technology-mediated harm against minors. Content Warning: This paper discusses sexual abuse.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web GUI agents are increasingly automating everyday online tasks. Despite their popularity, little is known about how users' preferences and values impact agents' reasoning and behavior. In this work, we investigate how both explicit and implicit user preferences, as well as the underlying user values, influence agent decision-making and action trajectories. We built a controlled testbed of 14 common interactive web tasks, spanning shopping, travel, dining, and housing, each replicated from real websites and integrated with a low-fidelity LLM-based recommender system. We injected 12 human preferences and values as personas into four state-of-the-art agents and systematically analyzed their task behaviors. Our results show that preference and value-infused prompts consistently guided agents toward outcomes that reflected these preferences and values. While the absence of user preference or value guidance led agents to exhibit a strong efficiency bias and employ shortest-path strategies, their presence steered agents' behavior trajectories through the greater use of corresponding filters and interactive web features. Despite their influence, dominant interface cues, such as discounts and advertisements, frequently overrode these effects, shortening the agents' action trajectories and inducing rationalizations that masked rather than reflected value-consistent reasoning. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) an open-source testbed for studying the influence of values in agent behaviors, and (2) an empirical investigation of how user preferences and values shape web agent behaviors.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly used in education for learning support. An application is "learning by explaining", where learners explain their understanding to an agent. However, existing research focuses on single roles, leaving it unclear how different pedagogical roles influence learners' interaction patterns, learning outcomes and experiences. We conducted a between-subjects study (N=96) comparing agents with three pedagogical roles (Tutee, Peer, Challenger) and a control condition while learning an economics concept. We found that different pedagogical roles shaped learning dynamics, including interaction patterns and experiences. Specifically, the Tutee agent elicited the most cognitive investment but led to high pressure. The Peer agent fostered high absorption and interest through collaborative dialogue. The Challenger agent promoted cognitive and metacognitive acts, enhancing critical thinking with moderate pressure. The findings highlight how agent roles shape different learning dynamics, guiding the design of educational agents tailored to specific pedagogical goals and learning phases.

Abstract: High-fidelity haptic feedback is essential for immersive virtual environments, yet authoring realistic tactile textures remains a significant bottleneck for designers. We introduce HapticMatch, a visual-to-tactile generation framework designed to democratize haptic content creation. We present a novel dataset containing precisely aligned pairs of micro-scale optical images, surface height maps, and friction-induced vibrations for 100 diverse materials. Leveraging this data, we explore and demonstrate that conditional generative models like diffusion and flow-matching can synthesize high-fidelity, renderable surface geometries directly from standard RGB photos. By enabling a "Scan-to-Touch" workflow, HapticMatch allows interaction designers to rapidly prototype multimodal surface sensations without specialized recording equipment, bridging the gap between visual and tactile immersion in VR/AR interfaces.

Abstract: People are increasingly turning to generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) for emotional support and companionship. While trust is likely to play a central role in enabling these informal and unsupervised interactions, we still lack an understanding of how people develop and experience it in this context. Seeking to fill this gap, we recruited 24 frequent users of generative AI for emotional support and conducted a qualitative study consisting of diary entries about interactions, transcripts of chats with AI, and in-depth interviews. Our results suggest important novel drivers of trust in this context: familiarity emerging from personalisation, nuanced mental models of generative AI, and awareness of people's control over conversations. Notably, generative AI's homogeneous use of personalised, positive, and persuasive language appears to promote some of these trust-building factors. However, this also seems to discourage other trust-related behaviours, such as remembering that generative AI is a machine trained to converse in human language. We present implications for future research that are likely to become critical as the use of generative AI for emotional support increasingly overlaps with therapeutic work.

Abstract: Mobile phones, as simultaneously personal and shared technologies, complicate how partners manage digital privacy in intimate relationships. While prior research has examined device-access practices, explicit privacy-rule negotiation, and toxic practices such as surveillance, little is known about how couples manage digital privacy without direct discussion in everyday relationships. To address this gap, we ask: How is digital privacy managed nonverbally and across different media on mobile phones? Drawing on 20 semi-structured interviews, we find that partners often regulate privacy practices through privacy silence -- the intentional avoidance of privacy-related conversations. We identify five motivations for leaving boundaries unspoken: perceiving privacy as unnecessary in intimacy, assuming implicit respect for boundaries, signaling trust and closeness, avoiding potential conflict or harm, and responding to broader societal and cultural expectations that discourage explicit privacy talk. We also identify a hierarchical grouping of content-specific privacy sensitivities, ranging from highly private domains such as financial data to lower-risk domains such as streaming accounts, and show how these priorities shift across relationship stages. These findings show how silence, culture, and content sensitivity shape everyday boundary-setting and underscore the relational and emotional dynamics underpinning mobile phone privacy management.

Abstract: We explore the potential of visualization to support musicians in instrument practice through real-time feedback and reflection on their playing. Musicians often struggle to observe the patterns in their playing and interpret them with respect to their goals. Our premise is that these patterns can be made visible with interactive visualization: we can make the unhearable visible. However, understanding the design of such visualizations is challenging: the diversity of needs, including different instruments, skills, musical attributes, and genres, means that any single use case is unlikely to illustrate the broad potential and opportunities. To address this challenge, we conducted a design exploration study where we created and iterated on 33 designs, each focusing on a subset of needs, for example, only one musical skill. Our designs are grounded in our own experience as musicians and the ideas and feedback of 18 musicians with various musical backgrounds and we evaluated them with 13 music learners and teachers. This paper presents the results of our exploration, focusing on a few example designs as instances of possible instrument practice visualizations. From our work, we draw design considerations that contribute to future research and products for visual instrument education.

Abstract: People increasingly turn to conversational agents such as ChatGPT to seek guidance for their personal problems. As these systems grow in capability, many now display elements of "thinking": short reflective statements that reveal a model's intentions or values before responding. While initially introduced to promote transparency, such visible thinking can also anthropomorphise the agent and shape user expectations. Yet little is known about how these displays affect user perceptions in help-seeking contexts. We conducted a 3 x 2 mixed design experiment examining the impact of 'Thinking Content' (None, Emotionally-Supportive, Expertise-Supportive) and 'Conversation Context' (Habit-related vs. Feelings-related problems) on users' perceptions of empathy, warmth, competence, and engagement. Participants interacted with a chatbot that either showed no visible thinking or presented value-oriented reflections prior to its response. Our findings contribute to understanding how thinking transparency influences user experience in supportive dialogues, and offer implications for designing conversational agents that communicate intentions in sensitive, help-seeking scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) systems are inherently non-deterministic, producing varied outputs even for identical inputs. While this variability is central to their appeal, it challenges established HCI evaluation practices that typically assume consistent and predictable system behavior. Designing controlled lab studies under such conditions therefore remains a key methodological challenge. We present a reflective multi-case analysis of four lab-based user studies with GenAI-integrated prototypes, spanning conversational in-car assistant systems and image generation tools for design workflows. Through cross-case reflection and thematic analysis across all study phases, we identify five methodological challenges and propose eighteen practice-oriented recommendations, organized into five guidelines. These challenges represent methodological constructs that are either amplified, redefined, or newly introduced by GenAI's stochastic nature: (C1) reliance on familiar interaction patterns, (C2) fidelity-control trade-offs, (C3) feedback and trust, (C4) gaps in usability evaluation, and (C5) interpretive ambiguity between interface and system issues. Our guidelines address these challenges through strategies such as reframing onboarding to help participants manage unpredictability, extending evaluation with constructs such as trust and intent alignment, and logging system events, including hallucinations and latency, to support transparent analysis. This work contributes (1) a methodological reflection on how GenAI's stochastic nature unsettles lab-based HCI evaluation and (2) eighteen recommendations that help researchers design more transparent, robust, and comparable studies of GenAI systems in controlled settings.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency wallets have become the primary gateway to decentralized applications, yet users often face significant difficulty in discerning what a wallet signature actually does or entails. Prior work has mainly focused on mitigating protocol vulnerabilities, with limited attention to how users perceive and interpret what they are authorizing. To examine this usability-security gap, we conducted two formative studies investigating how users interpret authentic signing requests and what cues they rely on to assess risk. Findings reveal that users often misread critical parameters, underestimate high-risk signatures, and rely on superficial familiarity rather than understanding transaction intent. Building on these insights, we designed the Signature Semantic Decoder -- a prototype framework that reconstructs and visualizes the intent behind wallet signatures prior to confirmation. Through structured parsing and semantic labeling, it demonstrates how signing data can be transformed into plain-language explanations with contextual risk cues. In a between-subjects user study (N = 128), participants using the prototype achieved higher accuracy in identifying risky signatures, improved clarity and decision confidence, and lower cognitive workload compared with the baseline wallet interface. Our study reframes wallet signing as a problem of interpretability within secure interaction design and offers design implications for more transparent and trustworthy cryptocurrency wallet interfaces.

Abstract: Obtaining meaningful and informed consent from users is essential for ensuring they maintain autonomy and control over their data. Notice and consent, the standard for collecting consent online, has been criticized. While other individualized solutions have been proposed, this paper argues that a collective approach to consent is worth exploring for several reasons. First, the data of different users is often interlinked, and individual data governance decisions may impact others. Second, harms resulting from data processing are often communal in nature. Finally, having every individual sufficiently informed about data collection practices to ensure truly informed consent has proven impractical.
  We propose collective consent, operationalized through consent assemblies, as one alternative framework. We establish the theoretical foundations of collective consent and employ speculative design to envision how consent assemblies could function by leveraging deliberative mini-publics. We present two vignettes: i) replacing notice and consent, and ii) collecting consent for GenAI model training, to demonstrate its wide application. Our paper employs future backcasting to identify the requirements for realizing collective consent and explores its potential applications in contexts where individual consent is infeasible.

Abstract: Ultrasound midair haptics (UMH) can present non-contact tactile stimuli using focused ultrasound without restricting the user's movement. Recently, UMH has been shown to present not only conventional vibrotactile sensations but also static pressure sensations by locally rotating an ultrasound focus at several hertz. With these pressure and vibration sensations, UMH covers three mechanoreceptors on which tactile perception relies: SA-I, FA-I, and FA-II. This study proposes a texture rendering method in UMH based on these receptor characteristics. Three basic ultrasonic stimuli corresponding to each mechanoreceptor are designed, and tactile textures are rendered through their combinations. For SA-I, a pressure stimuli were employed. For FA-I and FA-II, vibration stimuli at 30 Hz and 150 Hz, respectively, are employed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can render at least six discriminable textures with different roughness and friction sensations. Notably, through comparisons with real physical objects, we found that the pressure-only stimulus was perceived as slippery and smooth. Its smoothness was similar to a glass-marble. When vibration stimuli were synthesized, the perceived roughness and friction increased significantly. The roughness level reached that of a 100-grit sandpaper.

Abstract: People's transportation choices reflect complex trade-offs shaped by personal preferences, social norms, and technology acceptance. Predicting such behavior at scale is a critical challenge with major implications for urban planning and sustainable transport. Traditional methods use handcrafted assumptions and costly data collection, making them impractical for early-stage evaluations of new technologies or policies. We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLM-based applications are being developed to facilitate romantic relationships with AI partners, yet the safety and privacy risks in these partnerships remain largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate privacy in human-AI romantic relationships through an interview study (N=17), examining participants' experiences and privacy perceptions across stages of exploration, intimacy, and dissolution, alongside platforms they used. We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants voiced concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity. Overall, platform affordances and diverse romantic dynamics expand the privacy landscape, underscoring the need to rethink how privacy is constructed in human-AI intimacy.

Abstract: Accurate neuronavigation is critical for effective transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), as stimulation outcomes depend directly on precise coil placement. Existing neuronavigation systems are often costly, complex, and prone to tracking errors. To address these limitations, we present a computer vision based neuronavigation system that enables real time tracking of the patient and TMS instrumentation. The system integrates a multi camera optical tracking setup with consumer grade hardware and visible markers to drive a digital twin of the stimulation process. A dynamic 3D brain model in Unity updates in real time to visualize coil position and estimated stimulation targets. Augmented reality (AR) is further incorporated to project this model directly onto the patient's head, enabling intuitive, in situ coil adjustment without reliance on abstract numerical displays. Overall, the proposed approach improves spatial precision and accuracy while enhancing usability.

Abstract: Trust and reliance are often treated as coupled constructs in human-AI interaction research, with the assumption that calibrating trust will lead to appropriate reliance. We challenge this assumption in educational contexts, where students increasingly turn to AI for learning support. Through semi-structured interviews with graduate students (N=8) comparing AI-generated and human-generated responses, we find a systematic dissociation: students exhibit high trust but low reliance on human experts due to social barriers (fear of judgment, help-seeking anxiety), while showing low trust but high reliance on AI systems due to social affordances (accessibility, anonymity, judgment-free interaction). Using Mutual Theory of Mind as an analytical lens, we demonstrate that trust is shaped by epistemic evaluations while reliance is driven by social factors -- and these may operate independently.
