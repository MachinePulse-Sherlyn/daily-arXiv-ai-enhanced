Abstract: Universal Multimodal embedding models built on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have traditionally employed contrastive learning, which aligns representations of query-target pairs across different modalities. Yet, despite its empirical success, they are primarily built on a "single-turn" formulation where each query-target pair is treated as an independent data point. This paradigm leads to computational inefficiency when scaling, as it requires a separate forward pass for each pair and overlooks potential contextual relationships between multiple queries that can relate to the same context. In this work, we introduce Multi-Turn Contrastive Learning (MuCo), a dialogue-inspired framework that revisits this process. MuCo leverages the conversational nature of MLLMs to process multiple, related query-target pairs associated with a single image within a single forward pass. This allows us to extract a set of multiple query and target embeddings simultaneously, conditioned on a shared context representation, amplifying the effective batch size and overall training efficiency. Experiments exhibit MuCo with a newly curated 5M multimodal multi-turn dataset (M3T), which yields state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB and M-BEIR benchmarks, while markedly enhancing both training efficiency and representation coherence across modalities. Code and M3T are available at https://github.com/naver-ai/muco

Abstract: In recent years, the study of scaling laws for large recommendation models has gradually gained attention. Works such as Wukong, HiFormer, and DHEN have attempted to increase the complexity of interaction structures in ranking models and validate scaling laws between performance and parameters/FLOPs by stacking multiple layers. However, their experimental scale remains relatively limited. Our previous work introduced the TokenMixer architecture, an efficient variant of the standard Transformer where the self-attention mechanism is replaced by a simple reshape operation, and the feed-forward network is adapted to a pertoken FFN. The effectiveness of this architecture was demonstrated in the ranking stage by the model presented in the RankMixer paper. However, this foundational TokenMixer architecture itself has several design limitations. In this paper, we propose TokenMixer-Large, which systematically addresses these core issues: sub-optimal residual design, insufficient gradient updates in deep models, incomplete MoE sparsification, and limited exploration of scalability. By leveraging a mixing-and-reverting operation, inter-layer residuals, the auxiliary loss and a novel Sparse-Pertoken MoE architecture, TokenMixer-Large successfully scales its parameters to 7-billion and 15-billion on online traffic and offline experiments, respectively. Currently deployed in multiple scenarios at ByteDance, TokenMixer -Large has achieved significant offline and online performance gains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Lifelong user modeling, which leverages users' long-term behavior sequences for CTR prediction, has been widely applied in personalized services. Existing methods generally adopted a two-stage "retrieval-refinement" strategy to balance effectiveness and efficiency. However, they still suffer from (i) noisy retrieval due to skewed data distribution and (ii) lack of semantic understanding in refinement. While semantic enhancement, e.g., LLMs modeling or semantic embeddings, offers potential solutions to these two challenges, these approaches face impractical inference costs or insufficient representation granularity. Obsorbing multi-granularity and lightness merits of semantic identity (SID), we propose a novel paradigm that equips retrieval and refinement in Lifelong User Modeling with SEmantic IDs (R2LED) to address these issues. First, we introduce a Multi-route Mixed Retrieval for the retrieval stage. On the one hand, it captures users' interests from various granularities by several parallel recall routes. On the other hand, a mixed retrieval mechanism is proposed to efficiently retrieve candidates from both collaborative and semantic views, reducing noise. Then, for refinement, we design a Bi-level Fusion Refinement, including a target-aware cross-attention for route-level fusion and a gate mechanism for SID-level fusion. It can bridge the gap between semantic and collaborative spaces, exerting the merits of SID. The comprehensive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in both performance and efficiency. To facilitate the reproduction, we have released the code online https://github.com/abananbao/R2LED.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval models are becoming increasingly important in scenarios such as food delivery, where rich multimodal features can meet diverse user needs and enable precise retrieval. Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world Meituan data demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 3.80%, 2.64%, and 2.17% on R@5, R@10, and R@20, and 5.10%, 4.22%, and 2.09% on N@5, N@10, and N@20 compared to mainstream baselines. Online A/B testing on the Meituan platform shows that our approach achieves a 1.12% increase in revenue and a 1.02% increase in click-through rate, validating the effectiveness and superiority of our method in practical applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) models predict a user's next interaction by modeling their historical behaviors. Transformer-based SR methods, notably BERT4Rec, effectively capture these patterns but incur significant computational overhead due to extensive intermediate computations associated with Softmax-based attention. We propose Cotten4Rec, a novel SR model utilizing linear-time cosine similarity attention, implemented through a single optimized compute unified device architecture (CUDA) kernel. By minimizing intermediate buffers and kernel-launch overhead, Cotten4Rec substantially reduces resource usage compared to BERT4Rec and the linear-attention baseline, LinRec, especially for datasets with moderate sequence lengths and vocabulary sizes. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets confirm that Cotten4Rec achieves considerable reductions in memory and runtime with minimal compromise in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating Cotten4Rec's viability as an efficient alternative for practical, large-scale sequential recommendation scenarios where computational resources are critical.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This study examines the hierarchical structure of financial needs as articulated in social media discourse, employing generative AI techniques to analyze large-scale textual data. While human needs encompass a broad spectrum from fundamental survival to psychological fulfillment financial needs are particularly critical, influencing both individual well-being and day-to-day decision-making. Our research advances the understanding of financial behavior by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to extract and analyze expressions of financial needs from social media posts. We hypothesize that financial needs are organized hierarchically, progressing from short-term essentials to long-term aspirations, consistent with theoretical frameworks established in the behavioral sciences. Through computational analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying these needs and validate the presence of a hierarchical structure within them. In addition to confirming this structure, our findings provide novel insights into the content and themes of financial discussions online. By inferring underlying needs from naturally occurring language, this approach offers a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional survey methodologies, enabling a more dynamic and nuanced understanding of financial behavior in real-world contexts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Studying political activity on social media often requires defining and measuring political stances of users or content. Relevant examples include the study of opinion polarization, or the study of political diversity in online content diets. While many research designs rely on operationalizations best suited for the US setting, few allow addressing more general political systems, in which users and media outlets might exhibit stances on multiple ideology and issue dimensions, going beyond traditional Liberal-Conservative or Left-Right scales. To advance the study of more general online ecosystems, we present a dataset pertaining to a population of X/Twitter users, parliamentarians, and media outlets embedded in a political space spanned by dimensions measuring attitudes towards immigration, the EU, liberal values, elites and institutions, nationalism and the environment, in addition to left-right and liberal-conservative scales. We include indicators of individual activity and popularity: mean number of posts per day, number of followers, and number of followees. We provide several benchmarks validating the positions of these entities and discuss several applications for this dataset.

Abstract: During product conceptualization, capturing the non-linear history and cognitive intent is crucial. Traditional sketching tools often lose this context. We introduce DIMES (Design Idea Management and Evolution capture System), a web-based environment featuring sGIT (SketchGit), a custom visual version control architecture, and Generative AI. sGIT includes AEGIS, a module using hybrid Deep Learning and Machine Learning models to classify six stroke types. The system maps Git primitives to design actions, enabling implicit branching and multi-modal commits (stroke data + voice intent). In a comparative study, experts using DIMES demonstrated a 160% increase in breadth of concept exploration. Generative AI modules generated narrative summaries that enhanced knowledge transfer; novices achieved higher replication fidelity (Neural Transparency-based Cosine Similarity: 0.97 vs. 0.73) compared to manual summaries. AI-generated renderings also received higher user acceptance (Purchase Likelihood: 4.2 vs 3.1). This work demonstrates that intelligent version control bridges creative action and cognitive documentation, offering a new paradigm for design education.

Abstract: In human conversation, empathic dialogue requires nuanced temporal cues indicating whether the conversational partner is paying attention. This type of "active listening" is overlooked in the design of Conversational Agents (CAs), which use the same pacing for one conversation. To model the temporal cues in human conversation, we need CAs that dynamically adjust response pacing according to user input. We qualitatively analyzed ten cases of active listening to distill five context-aware pacing strategies: Reflective Silence, Facilitative Silence, Empathic Silence, Holding Space, and Immediate Response. In a between-subjects study (N=50) with two conversational scenarios (relationship and career-support), the context-aware agent scored higher than static-pacing control on perceived human-likeness, smoothness, and interactivity, supporting deeper self-disclosure and higher engagement. In the career support scenario, the CA yielded higher perceived listening quality and affective trust. This work shows how insights from human conversation like context-aware pacing can empower the design of more empathic human-AI communication.

Abstract: People differ in how much they move their head versus their eyes when shifting gaze, yet such tendencies remain largely unexplored in HCI. We introduce head movement tendencies as a fundamental dimension of individual difference in VR and provide a quantitative account of their population-level distribution. Using a 360° video free-viewing dataset (N=87), we model head contributions to gaze shifts with a hinge-based parametric function, revealing a spectrum of strategies from eye-movers to head-movers. We then conduct a user study (N=28) combining 360° video viewing with a short controlled task using gaze targets. While parameter values differ across tasks, individuals show partial alignment in their relative positions within the population, indicating that tendencies are meaningful but shaped by context. Our findings establish head movement tendencies as an important concept for VR and highlight implications for adaptive systems such as foveated rendering, viewport alignment, and multi-user experience design.

Abstract: Cookie banners and privacy settings attempt to give users a sense of control over how their personal data is collected and used, but background tracking of personal information often continues unnoticed. To explore how such invisible data collection might be made more perceptible, we present DataCrumb, a physical probe that reacts in real-time to data tracking with visual and auditory feedback. Using a research-through-design approach, we deployed the artifact in three households and studied participants' responses. Instead of providing details about what data was being tracked, the artifact introduced subtle disruptions that made background data flows harder to ignore. Participants described new forms of awareness, contradiction, and fatigue. Our findings show how sensory feedback can support reflection by drawing attention to tracking data flows that are usually hidden. We argue for designing systems that foster awareness and interpretation, especially when the users' control and understanding are limited.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scientists often use generics, that is, unquantified statements about whole categories of people or phenomena, when communicating research findings (e.g., "statins reduce cardiovascular events"). Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, frequently adopt the same style when summarizing scientific texts. However, generics can prompt overgeneralizations, especially when they are interpreted differently across audiences. In a study comparing laypeople, scientists, and two leading LLMs (ChatGPT-5 and DeepSeek), we found systematic differences in interpretation of generics. Compared to most scientists, laypeople judged scientific generics as more generalizable and credible, while LLMs rated them even higher. These mismatches highlight significant risks for science communication. Scientists may use generics and incorrectly assume laypeople share their interpretation, while LLMs may systematically overgeneralize scientific findings when summarizing research. Our findings underscore the need for greater attention to language choices in both human and LLM-mediated science communication.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Asynchronous, text-based discourse-such as students' posts in discussion forums-is widely used to support collaborative learning. However, the distributed and evolving nature of such discourse often makes it difficult to see how ideas connect, develop, and build on one another over time. As a result, learners may struggle to recognize relationships among ideas-a process that is critical for idea advancement in productive collaborative discourse. To address this challenge, we explore how large language models (LLMs) can provide representational guidance by modeling student discourse as a Knowledge Synthesis Graph (KSG). The KSG identifies ideas from student discourse and visualizes their epistemic relationships, externalizing the current state of collaborative knowledge in a form that can support further inquiry and idea advancement. In this study, we present the design of the KSG and evaluate the LLM-based approach for constructing KSGs from authentic student discourse data. Through multi-round human-expert coding and prompt iteration, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using our approach to construct reliable KSGs across different models. This work provides a technical foundation for modeling collaborative discourse with LLMs and offers pedagogical implications for augmenting complex knowledge work in collaborative learning environments.

Abstract: Product designers often begin their design process with handcrafted personas. While personas are intended to ground design decisions in consumer preferences, they often fall short in practice by remaining abstract, expensive to produce, and difficult to translate into actionable design features. As a result, personas risk serving as static reference points rather than tools that actively shape design outcomes. To address these challenges, we built Personagram, an interactive system powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that helps designers explore detailed census-based personas, extract product features inferred from persona attributes, and recombine them for specific customer segments. In a study with 12 professional designers, we show that Personagram facilitates more actionable ideation workflows by structuring multimodal thinking from persona attributes to product design features, achieving higher engagement with personas, perceived transparency, and satisfaction compared to a chat-based baseline. We discuss implications of integrating AI-generated personas into product design workflows.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) technologies are increasingly adopted by enterprises to enhance remote collaboration, enabling users to share real-time views of their physical environments through head-mounted displays (HMDs). While MR spatial sharing offers significant benefits, it introduces complex security and privacy risks, particularly in balancing employee collaboration needs with enterprise data protection requirements across office and personal spaces. This paper investigates these challenges through formative interviews with employees and expert consultations with professionals in cybersecurity, IoT, technology risk, and corporate legal domains. We present a conceptual framework for secure MR spatial sharing in enterprise contexts and identify critical concerns and requirements for system design. Based on our findings, we offer actionable recommendations to guide the development of secure and privacy-preserving MR spatial sharing solutions for future enterprise deployments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As autonomous vehicles enter public spaces, external human-machine interfaces are proposed to support communication with external road users. A decade of research has produced hundreds of studies and reviews, yet it remains unclear whether the field is converging on shared principles or diverging across approaches. We present a multi-dimensional analysis of 620 publications, complemented by industry deployments and regulatory documents, to track research evolution and identify convergence. The analysis reveals several field-level patterns. First, convergence on a safety-first core: simple visual cues that clarify intent. Second, sustained divergence in necessity and implementation. Third, a progressive filtering funnel: broad exploration in research and concepts narrows in deployment and is codified by regulation into a minimal set of permitted signals. These insights point to a shift in emphasis for future work, from producing new prototypes toward consolidating evidence, clarifying points of contention, and developing frameworks that can adapt across contexts.

Abstract: Fact verification is a critical yet underexplored component of non-litigation legal practice. While existing research has examined automation in legal workflow and human-AI collaboration in high-stakes domains, little is known about how GenAI can support fact verification, a task that demands prudent judgment and strict accountability. To address this, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 lawyers to understand their current verification practices, attitudes toward GenAI adoption, and expectations for future systems. We found that while lawyers use GenAI for low-risk tasks like drafting and language optimization, concerns over accuracy, confidentiality, and liability are currently limiting its adoption for fact verification. These concerns translate into core design requirements for AI systems that are trustworthy and accountable. Based on these, we contribute design insights for human-AI collaboration in legal fact verification, emphasizing the development of auditable systems that balance efficiency with professional judgment and uphold ethical and legal accountability in high-stakes practice.

Abstract: Generative AI has greatly transformed creative work in various domains, such as screenwriting. To understand this transformation, prior research often focused on capturing a snapshot of human-AI co-creation practice at a specific moment, with less attention to how humans mobilize, regulate, and reflect to form the practice gradually. Motivated by Bandura's theory of human agency, we conducted a two-week study with 19 professional screenwriters to investigate how they embraced AI in their creation process. Our findings revealed that screenwriters not only mindfully planned, foresaw, and responded to AI usage, but, more importantly, through reflections on practice, they developed themselves and human-AI co-creation paradigms, such as cognition, strategies, and workflows. They also expressed various expectations for how future AI should better support their agency. Based on our findings, we conclude this paper with extensive discussion and actionable suggestions to screenwriters, tool developers, and researchers for sustainable human-AI co-creation.

Abstract: Semi-structured interviews are a common method in qualitative research. However, conducting high-quality interviews is challenging, as it requires interviewers to actively listen to participants, adapt their plans as the conversation unfolds, and probe effectively. We propose InterFlow, an AI-powered visual scaffold that helps interviewers manage the interview flow and facilitates real-time data sensemaking. The system dynamically adapts the interview script to the ongoing conversation and provides a visual timer to track interview progress and conversational balance. It further supports information capture with three levels of automation: manual entry, AI-assisted summary with user-specified focus, and a co-interview agent that proactively surfaces potential follow-up points. A within-subject user study (N = 12) indicates that InterFlow reduces interviewers' cognitive load and facilitates the interview process. Based on the user study findings, we provide design implications for unobtrusive and agency-preserving AI assistance under time-sensitive and cognitively demanding situations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Intelligent text entry (ITE) methods, such as word suggestions, are widely used in mobile typing, yet improving ITE systems is challenging because the cognitive mechanisms behind suggestion use remain poorly understood, and evaluating new systems often requires long-term user studies to account for behavioral adaptation. We present WSTypist, a reinforcement learning-based model that simulates how typists integrate word suggestions into typing. It builds on recent hierarchical control models of typing, but focuses on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the high-level decision-making for effectively integrating word suggestions into manual typing: assessing efficiency gains, considering orthographic uncertainties, and including personal reliance on AI support. Our evaluations show that WSTypist simulates diverse human-like suggestion-use strategies, reproduces individual differences, and generalizes across different systems. Importantly, we demonstrate on four design cases how computational rationality models can be used to inform what-if analyses during the design process, by simulating how users might adapt to changes in the UI or in the algorithmic support, reducing the need for long-term user studies.

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships for qualitative data analysis in HCI and social science research enables the understanding of user needs and theory building. However, current computational tools primarily characterize and categorize qualitative data; the few systems that analyze causal relationships either inadequately consider context, lack credibility, or produce overly complex outputs. We first conducted a formative study with 15 participants interested in using computational tools for exploring causal relationships in qualitative data to understand their needs and derive design guidelines. Based on these findings, we designed and implemented QualCausal, a system that extracts and illustrates causal relationships through interactive causal network construction and multi-view visualization. A feedback study (n = 15) revealed that participants valued our system for reducing the analytical burden and providing cognitive scaffolding, yet navigated how such systems fit within their established research paradigms, practices, and habits. We discuss broader implications for designing computational tools that support qualitative data analysis.

Abstract: Digital behaviour change systems increasingly rely on repeated, system-initiated messages to support users in everyday contexts. LLMs enable these messages to be personalised consistently across interactions, yet it remains unclear whether such personalisation improves individual messages or instead shapes users' perceptions through patterns of exposure. We explore this question in the context of LLM-generated JITAIs, which are short, context-aware messages delivered at moments deemed appropriate to support behaviour change, using physical activity as an application domain. In a controlled retrospective study, 90 participants evaluated messages generated using four LLM strategies: baseline prompting, few-shot prompting, fine-tuned models, and retrieval augmented generation, each implemented with and without Big Five Personality Traits to produce personality-aligned communication across multiple scenarios. Using ordinal multilevel models with within-between decomposition, we distinguish trial-level effects, whether personality information improves evaluations of individual messages, from person-level exposure effects, whether participants receiving higher proportions of personality-informed messages exhibit systematically different overall perceptions. Results showed no trial-level associations, but participants who received higher proportions of BFPT-informed messages rated the messages as more personalised, appropriate, and reported less negative affect. We use Communication Accommodation Theory for post-hoc analysis. These results suggest that personality-based personalisation in behaviour change systems may operate primarily through aggregate exposure rather than per-message optimisation, with implications for how adaptive systems are designed and evaluated in sustained human-AI interaction. In-situ longitudinal studies are needed to validate these findings in real-world contexts.

Abstract: In the age of Large Language Models (LLMs), much work has already been done on how LLMs support medication advice and serve as information providers; however, how mothers use these tools for emotional and informational support to avoid social judgment remains underexplored. In this study, we have conducted a 10-day mixed-methods exploratory survey (N=107) to investigate how mothers use LLMs as a non-judgmental resource for emotional support and regulation, as well as situational reassurance. Our findings show that mothers are asking LLMs various questions about childcare to reassure themselves and avoid judgment, particularly around childcare decisions, maternal guilt, and late-night caregiving. Open-ended responses also show that mothers are comfortable with LLMs because they do not have to think about social consequences or judgment. Although they use LLMs for quick information or reassurance to avoid judgment, the results also show that more than half of the participants value human warmth over LLMs; however, a significant minority, especially those who live in a joint family, consider LLMs to avoid human judgment. These findings help us understand how we can frame LLMs as low-risk interaction support rather than as a replacement for human support, and highlight the role of social context in shaping emotional technology use.

Abstract: LLM-based agents can complete tasks correctly yet still frustrate users through poor interaction patterns, such as excessive confirmations, opaque reasoning, or misaligned pacing. Current benchmarks evaluate task accuracy but overlook how agents interact: whether they infer preferences from implicit cues, adapt dynamically, or maintain fine-grained interaction quality. We introduce Prefix, a configurable environment that evaluates both what agents accomplish and how they interact. Central to Prefix is the Interaction-as-a-Tool (IaaT) paradigm, which treats interaction behaviors as structured tool calls, unifying them with existing evaluation frameworks. We define 31 preference settings across 14 attributes and formalize user experience (UX) as a core metric alongside task accuracy. A composite LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism across seven UX dimensions achieves strong aggregate reliability (ICC > 0.79), high internal consistency (alpha = 0.943), and human correlation (rho = 0.52-0.78). Preference-aware agents show 7.6% average UX improvement and 18.5% gain in preference alignment. Our work is openly accessible.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping education, but it also raises concerns about instability and overreliance. In programming classrooms, we aim to leverage its feedback capabilities while reinforcing the educator's role in guiding student-AI interactions. We developed ClassAid, a real-time orchestration system that integrates TA Agents to provide personalized support and an AI-driven dashboard that visualizes student-AI interactions, enabling instructors to dynamically adjust TA Agent modes. Instructors can configure the Agent to provide technical feedback (direct coding solutions), heuristic feedback (hint-based guidance), automatic feedback (autonomously selecting technical or heuristic support), or silent operation (no AI support). We evaluated ClassAid through three aspects: (1) the TA Agents' performance, (2) feedback from 54 students and one instructor during a classroom deployment, and (3) interviews with eight educators. Results demonstrate that dynamic instructor control over AI supports effective real-time personalized feedback and provides design implications for integrating AI into authentic educational settings.

Abstract: Colors and shapes are commonly used to encode categories in multi-class scatterplots. Designers often combine the two channels to create redundant encodings, aiming to enhance class distinctions. However, evidence for the effectiveness of redundancy remains conflicted, and guidelines for constructing effective combinations are limited. This paper presents four crowdsourced experiments evaluating redundant color-shape encodings and identifying high-performing configurations across different category numbers. Results show that redundancy significantly improves accuracy in assessing class-level correlations, with the strongest benefits for 5-8 categories. We also find pronounced interaction effects between colors and shapes, underscoring the need for careful pairing in designing redundant encodings. Drawing on these findings, we introduce a categorical palette design tool that enables designers to construct empirically grounded palettes for effective categorical visualization. Our work advances understanding of categorical perception in data visualization by systematically identifying effective redundant color-shape combinations and embedding these insights into a practical palette design tool.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly become embedded in interactive and im-mersive artistic environments, artists and technologists are discovering new opportunities to engage with their interpretive and autonomous capacities as creative collaborators in live performance. The focus of this work-in-progress is on outlining conceptual and technical foundations under which performance-makers and interactive architecture can collaborate within rehearsal settings. It introduces a rehearsal-oriented prototype system for shaping and testing AI-mediated environments within creative practice. This approach treats interactive architecture as a performative agent that senses spatial behaviour and speech, interprets these signals through a large language model, and generates real-time environmental adaptations. Designed for deployment in physical performance spaces, the system employs virtual blueprints to support iterative experimentation and creative dialogue between artists and AI agents, using reasoning traces to inform architectural interaction design grounded in dramaturgical principles.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) face increasing occupational stress and burnout. Supporting HCPs need for relatedness is fundamental to their psychological wellbeing and resilience. However, how technologies could support HCPs relatedness in the workplace remains less explored. This study incorporated semi-structured interviews (n = 15) and co-design workshops (n = 21) with HCPs working in the UK National Health Service (NHS), to explore their current practices and preferences for workplace relatedness support, and how technology could be utilized to benefit relatedness. Qualitative analysis yielded a four-layer model of HCPs relatedness need, which includes Informal Interactions, Camaraderie and Bond, Community and Organizational Care, and Shared Identity. Workshops generated eight design concepts (e.g., Playful Encounter, Collocated Action, and Memories and Stories) that operationalize the four relatedness need layers. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical relevance, practical design implications, and the necessity to strengthen relatedness support for HCPs in the era of digitalization and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on both uncertainty about the world and consideration of utilities of different outcomes, yet their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

Abstract: GUI grounding maps natural language instructions to the correct interface elements, serving as the perception foundation for GUI agents. Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown remarkable potential for solving complex tasks, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/smiling-world/JADE.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

Abstract: Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

Abstract: We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL), a setting in which an agent learns a single, universal policy capable of generalising to arbitrary, possibly unseen tasks. We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.

Abstract: Can AI agents predict whether they will succeed at a task? We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.
