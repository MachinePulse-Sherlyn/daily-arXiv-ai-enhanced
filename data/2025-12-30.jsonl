While prior research examines effects on banned communities or source platform health, the impact on alternative platforms that absorb displaced users remains understudied. We analyze four major Reddit ban waves (2015--2020) and their effects on generalist communities on Voat, asking how post-ban arrivals reshape community structure and through what mechanisms transformation occurs. Combining network analysis, toxicity detection, and dynamic reputation modeling, we identify two distinct regimes of migration impact: (1) Hostile Takeover (2015--2018), where post-ban arrival cohorts formed parallel social structures that bypassed existing community cores through sheer volume, and (2) Toxic Equilibrium (2018--2020), where the flattening of existing user hierarchy enabled newcomers to integrate into the now-dominant toxic community. Crucially, community transformation occurred through peripheral dynamics rather than hub capture: fewer than 5% of newcomers achieved central positions in most months, yet toxicity doubled. Migration structure also shaped outcomes: loosely organized communities dispersed into generalist spaces, while ideologically cohesive groups concentrated in dedicated enclaves. These findings suggest that receiving platforms face a narrow intervention window during the hostile takeover phase, after which toxic norms become self-sustaining."}

In our work, we introduce a two-layer random hypergraph model, in which hyperedges represent households and workplaces. Within this overlapping, adaptive structure, individuals react if their opinion is in majority in their groups. The process evolves through random steps: individuals can either change their opinion, or quit their workplace and join another one in which their opinion belongs to the majority. Based on computer simulations, our first goal is to describe the effect of the parameters responsible for the probability of changing opinion and quitting workplace on the homophily and speed of polarization. We also analyze the model as a Markov chain, and study the frequency of the absorbing states. Then, we quantitatively compare how different statistical and machine learning methods, in particular, linear regression, xgboost and a convolutional neural network perform for estimating these probabilities, based on partial information from the process, for example, the distribution of opinion configurations within households and workplaces. Among other observations, we conclude that all methods can achieve the best results under appropriate circumstances, and that the amount of information that is necessary to provide good results depends on the strength of the peer pressure effect."}

Unlike the mutually disconnected arrangement of elements in traditional RISs, BD-RIS creates cost-effective and simple inter-element connections, allowing for greater freedom in configuring the amplitude and phase of impinging waves. However, there are numerous underlying challenges in realizing the advantages associated with BD-RIS, prompting the research community to actively investigate cutting-edge schemes and algorithms in this direction. Particularly, the passive beamforming design for BD-RIS under specific environmental conditions has become a major focus in this research area. In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification. Subsequently, we present recent advances and identify a series of challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset. Consequently, we derive useful insights about the practical implications of BD-RIS."}

We show that, for a broad class of growing network models, information about model parameters is localized in the network, i.e., the likelihood can be expressed in terms of small subgraphs. We take a Bayesian perspective to inference and develop neural density estimators (NDEs) to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters using graph neural networks (GNNs) with limited receptive size, i.e., the GNN can only \"see\" small subgraphs. We characterize nine growing network models in terms of their localization and demonstrate that localization predictions agree with NDEs on simulated data. Even for non-localized models, NDEs can infer high-fidelity posteriors matching model-specific inference methods at a fraction of the cost. Our findings establish information localization as a fundamental property of network growth, theoretically justifying the analysis of local subgraphs embedded in larger, unobserved networks and the use of GNNs with limited receptive field for likelihood-free inference."}

Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder--decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm."}

For this reason, it is important to detect, recognize and understand emotions using computational systems to improve communication between people and machines, which would facilitate the ability of computers to understand the communication between humans. This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classification of people's emotions based on their EEG signals, for which the brain-computer interface EMOTIV EPOC was used. This allowed the collection of electroencephalographic information from 50 people, all of whom were shown audiovisual resources that helped to provoke the desired mood. The information obtained was stored in a database for the generation of the model and the corresponding classification analysis. Random Forest model was created for emotion prediction (happiness, sadness and relaxation), based on the signals of any person. The results obtained were 97.21% accurate for happiness, 76% for relaxation and 76% for sadness. Finally, the model was used to generate a real-time emotion prediction algorithm; it captures the person's EEG signals, executes the generated algorithm and displays the result on the screen with the help of images representative of each emotion."}

In large lectures, instructors face challenges on identifying students' knowledge gaps timely, which is critical for effective teaching. Existing classroom response systems rely on instructor-initiated interactions, which limits their ability to capture the spontaneous knowledge gaps that naturally emerge during lectures. With the widespread adoption of LLMs among students, we recognize these student-AI dialogues as a valuable, student-centered data source for identifying knowledge gaps. In this idea paper, we propose QueryQuilt, a multi-agent LLM framework that automatically detects common knowledge gaps in large-scale lectures by analyzing students' chat logs with AI assistants. QueryQuilt consists of two key components: (1) a Dialogue Agent that responds to student questions while employing probing questions to reveal underlying knowledge gaps, and (2) a Knowledge Gap Identification Agent that systematically analyzes these dialogues to identify knowledge gaps across the student population. By generating frequency distributions of identified gaps, instructors can gain comprehensive insights into class-wide understanding. Our evaluation demonstrates promising results, with QueryQuilt achieving 100% accuracy in identifying knowledge gaps among simulated students and 95% completeness when tested on real student-AI dialogue data. These initial findings indicate the system's potential for facilitate teaching in authentic learning environments. We plan to deploy QueryQuilt in actual classroom settings for comprehensive evaluation, measuring its detection accuracy and impact on instruction."}

Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further."}

Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs.

Parsons problems, which require learners to drag-and-drop blocks of code into the correct order and indentation, are proving to be beneficial for scaffolding learning how to write code from scratch. But little is known about the ability of other problem types to do so. This study explores learners' perceptions of a new programming environment called Codespec, which was developed to make computer programming more accessible and equitable by offering multiple means of engagement. Retrospective think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine programmers who were given the choice between Faded Parsons and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolding toward solving write-code problems. The results showed that offering Faded and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolds supported comprehension monitoring, strategy formation, and refinement of prior knowledge. Learners selectively used Faded Parsons problems for syntax/structure and Pseudocode Parsons problems for high-level reasoning. The costs noted included the time it takes to drag-and-drop the blocks and the confusion experienced when a solution diverges from a learners' mental model. Faded Parsons problems were also perceived as a desirable challenge. This study contributes to the field of computing education and human-computer interaction by extending the functionality of problem spaces that support Parsons problems and by providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of using other problem types as scaffolding techniques."}

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding.

We argue that addressing these challenges requires AI systems capable of actively mediating underlying knowledge gaps, power asymmetries, and contextual disconnects. To this end, we propose the Dynamic Boundary Mediation Framework, which reconceptualizes LLM-enhanced systems as adaptive boundary objects that shift mediating roles across therapeutic stages. The framework delineates three forms of mediation: Epistemic (reducing knowledge asymmetries), Relational (rebalancing power dynamics), and Contextual (bridging therapy-life discontinuities).

Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework. SPECTRE features two primary contributions: a physiologically-grounded pre-training task and a novel positional encoding. The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches.

EEG recordings are processed using a standard longitudinal bipolar montage and represented through a multi-domain feature set capturing temporal statistics, spectral structure, signal complexity, and inter-channel relationships. Disorder-aware machine learning models are trained under severe class imbalance, with decision thresholds explicitly calibrated to prioritize diagnostic sensitivity.\n  Evaluation on a large, heterogeneous clinical EEG dataset demonstrates that sensitivity-oriented modeling achieves recall exceeding 80% for the majority of disorder categories, with several low-prevalence conditions showing absolute recall gains of 15-30% after threshold calibration compared to default operating points.

This study looks at the rhetorical strategies of a novel method for conducting in-the-moment Data-Driven Classroom Interviews (DDCIs). By using Ordered Network Analysis (ONA) to reanalyze data from Wei et al.'s (2025) Epistemic Network Analysis, we better account for the sequences in which these rhetorical strategies emerge during the interview process. Specifically, we examine how five rhetorical strategies by interviewers relate to five possible rhetorical strategies used in student responses. As with the previous study, results demonstrate minor differences in how students with high and low situational interest respond. Namely, whereas students with high situational interest show moderately higher levels of enthusiasm, students with low situational interest are more likely to respond to interviewers with an explanation. However, overall this study confirms that there are few interviewer-driven differences in these interviews, and it documents that interviewers are following guidelines to rely upon open-ended questions"}

Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process."}

Heatmap represents dense multi-dimensional features derived from mmWave, but is significantly affected by multipath propagation and hardware modulation noise. PC, a set of 3D points, is obtained by applying the Constant False Alarm Rate algorithm to the Heatmap, which suppresses noise but results in sparse human-related features. To address these limitations, we study the feasibility of providing an alternative input paradigm: Differentiable Physics-driven Human Representation (DIPR), which represents humans as an ensemble of Gaussian distributions with kinematic and electromagnetic parameters. Inspired by Gaussian Splatting, DIPR leverages human kinematic priors and mmWave propagation physics to enhance human features while mitigating non-human noise through two strategies: 1) We incorporate prior kinematic knowledge to initialize DIPR based on the Heatmap and establish multi-faceted optimization objectives, ensuring biomechanical validity and enhancing motion features. 2) We simulate complete mmWave processing pipelines, re-render a new Heatmap from DIPR, and compare it with the original Heatmap, avoiding spurious noise generation due to kinematic constraints overfitting. Experimental results on three datasets with four methods demonstrate that existing mmWave-based HPE methods can easily integrate DIPR and achieve superior performance."}

E6BJA reproduces the core calculations of traditional flight computers while extending them through enhanced modelling capabilities such as the 1976 International Standard Atmosphere, carburettor icing risk estimation, and aircraft-specific weight and balance calculators.

In this paper, we introduce Cogniscope, a simulation framework that generates social-media-style interaction data for studying digital biomarkers of cognitive health. The framework models synthetic users with heterogeneous trajectories, embedding micro-tasks such as video summarization and lightweight question answering into content consumption streams. These interactions yield linguistic markers (semantic drift, disfluency) and behavioral signals (watch time, pausing, sharing), which can be fused to evaluate early detection models. We demonstrate the framework's use through ablation and sensitivity analyses, showing how detection performance varies across modalities, noise levels, and temporal windows. To support reproducibility, we release the generator code, parameter configurations, and synthetic datasets.

To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art."}

This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI."}

It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms."}

In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios."}

Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information.

Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism.

As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance.

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates."}

The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions.

Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness.

A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations."}

To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis.

This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling."}

However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints."}

Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead.

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems."}

SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data."}

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings."}

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification."}

Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\\exists^*\\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task."}

To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning.

Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL."}

A Computationally-Embedded Perspective on the Big World Hypothesis", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)", "summary": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases."}

However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development.

In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal.

Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes.

Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods."}

In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients.
