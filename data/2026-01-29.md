Abstract: Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made significant progress in the past few years but have only been loosely inter-connected. Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inference-time planning with large language models frequently breaks under partial observability: when task-critical preconditions are not specified at query time, models tend to hallucinate missing facts or produce plans that violate hard constraints. We introduce \textbf{Self-Querying Bidirectional Categorical Planning (SQ-BCP)}, which explicitly represents precondition status (\texttt{Sat}/\texttt{Viol}/\texttt{Unk}) and resolves unknowns via (i) targeted self-queries to an oracle/user or (ii) \emph{bridging} hypotheses that establish the missing condition through an additional action. SQ-BCP performs bidirectional search and invokes a pullback-based verifier as a categorical certificate of goal compatibility, while using distance-based scores only for ranking and pruning. We prove that when the verifier succeeds and hard constraints pass deterministic checks, accepted plans are compatible with goal requirements; under bounded branching and finite resolution depth, SQ-BCP finds an accepting plan when one exists. Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \textbf{14.9\%} and \textbf{5.8\%} (vs.\ \textbf{26.0\%} and \textbf{15.7\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Natural-language planning often involves vague predicates (e.g., suitable substitute, stable enough) whose satisfaction is inherently graded. Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements. We evaluate on (i) public PDDL3 preference/oversubscription benchmarks and (ii) RecipeNLG-Subs, a missing-substitute recipe-planning benchmark built from RecipeNLG with substitution candidates from Recipe1MSubs and FoodKG. FCP improves success and reduces hard-constraint violations on RecipeNLG-Subs compared to LLM-only and ReAct-style baselines, while remaining competitive with classical PDDL3 planners.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Today, E-commerce sellers face several key challenges, including difficulties in discovering and effectively utilizing available programs and tools, and struggling to understand and utilize rich data from various tools. We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator. IA has been launched for Amazon sellers in US, which has achieved high accuracy of 90% based on human evaluation, with latency of P90 below 15s.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents can translate high-level user intents into plans and actions in an environment. Yet after observing an outcome, users may wonder: What if I had phrased my intent differently? We introduce a framework that enables such counterfactual reasoning in agentic LLM-driven control scenarios, while providing formal reliability guarantees. Our approach models the closed-loop interaction between a user, an LLM-based agent, and an environment as a structural causal model (SCM), and leverages test-time scaling to generate multiple candidate counterfactual outcomes via probabilistic abduction. Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.

Abstract: As an important part of urbanization, the development monitoring of newly constructed parks is of great significance for evaluating the effect of urban planning and optimizing resource allocation. However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. Compared to vanilla GPT-4o and other agents, our approach enables robust multi-modal information fusion and analysis, offering reliable and scalable solutions tailored to the diverse and evolving demands of urban park development monitoring.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, yet their deployment in clinical settings demands rigorous verification to ensure factual accuracy. While reward models offer a scalable approach for reasoning trace verification, existing methods face two limitations: they produce only scalar reward values without explicit justification, and they rely on single-pass retrieval that precludes adaptive knowledge access as verification unfolds. We introduce $\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular. Crucially, $\method$ demonstrates an $\mathbf{8\times}$ reduction in sampling budget requirement compared to prior reward model baselines. These findings establish that grounding verification in dynamically retrieved evidence offers a principled path toward more reliable medical reasoning systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) exhibit strong understanding, yet this capability often fails to effectively guide generation. We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration. First, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) activates the model's latent evaluation ability via curriculum learning, producing a high-fidelity endogenous reward signal. Second, Reinforcement Learning with Model-rewarded Thinking (RLMT) leverages this signal to optimize the generative reasoning policy. Experiments show that SEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in evaluation accuracy, reprompting efficiency, and generation quality, without sacrificing general multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have rapidly expanded to electrocardiograms, focusing on classification, report generation, and single-turn QA tasks. However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue. To facilitate its development and evaluation, we also present ECG-Multi-Turn-Dialogue (ECG-MTD) dataset, a collection of realistic user-assistant multi-turn dialogues for diverse ECG lead configurations. We develop ECG-Agents in various sizes, from on-device capable to larger agents. Experimental results show that ECG-Agents outperform baseline ECG-LLMs in response accuracy. Furthermore, on-device agents achieve comparable performance to larger agents in various evaluations that assess response accuracy, tool-calling ability, and hallucinations, demonstrating their viability for real-world applications.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents has necessitated robust memory systems to support cohesive long-term interaction and complex reasoning. Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex, long-horizon reasoning due to instability caused by their frozen policy assumption. Current test-time scaling methods treat execution feedback merely as an external signal for filtering or rewriting trajectories, without internalizing it to improve the underlying reasoning strategy. Inspired by Popper's epistemology of "conjectures and refutations," we argue that intelligence requires real-time evolution of the model's policy through learning from failed attempts. We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors. Experiments show that PoT dramatically boosts performance: a 4B model achieves 49.71% accuracy on LiveCodeBench, outperforming GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 despite being over 50 smaller.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show great potential for enabling foundation models to complete real-world tasks, revolutionizing human-computer interaction and improving human productivity. In this report, we present OmegaUse, a general-purpose GUI agent model for autonomous task execution on both mobile and desktop platforms, supporting computer-use and phone-use scenarios. Building an effective GUI agent model relies on two factors: (1) high-quality data and (2) effective training methods. To address these, we introduce a carefully engineered data-construction pipeline and a decoupled training paradigm. For data construction, we leverage rigorously curated open-source datasets and introduce a novel automated synthesis framework that integrates bottom-up autonomous exploration with top-down taxonomy-guided generation to create high-fidelity synthetic data. For training, to better leverage these data, we adopt a two-stage strategy: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to establish fundamental interaction syntax, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve spatial grounding and sequential planning. To balance computational efficiency with agentic reasoning capacity, OmegaUse is built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone. To evaluate cross-terminal capabilities in an offline setting, we introduce OS-Nav, a benchmark suite spanning multiple operating systems: ChiM-Nav, targeting Chinese Android mobile environments, and Ubu-Nav, focusing on routine desktop interactions on Ubuntu. Extensive experiments show that OmegaUse is highly competitive across established GUI benchmarks, achieving a state-of-the-art (SOTA) score of 96.3% on ScreenSpot-V2 and a leading 79.1% step success rate on AndroidControl. OmegaUse also performs strongly on OS-Nav, reaching 74.24% step success on ChiM-Nav and 55.9% average success on Ubu-Nav.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves LLM reasoning but incurs high latency and memory cost due to verbose traces, motivating CoT compression with preserved correctness. Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/fanzhenxuan/Ctrl-CoT.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into human group settings raises essential questions about how these novel participants influence cooperative social norms. While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled automated heuristic design (AHD) for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but existing frameworks' reliance on fixed evolutionary rules and static prompt templates often leads to myopic heuristic generation, redundant evaluations, and limited reasoning about how new heuristics should be derived. We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.

Abstract: We study risk-sensitive planning under partial observability using the dynamic risk measure Iterated Conditional Value-at-Risk (ICVaR). A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $α$, where $α= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $α< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.
  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.
  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of "VCW as transitional framework." Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.
  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a robust mechanism for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large models. However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that MathForge significantly outperforms existing methods on various mathematical reasoning tasks. The code and augmented data are all available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MathForge.

Abstract: We investigate whether \emph{LLM-based agents} can develop task-oriented communication protocols that differ from standard natural language in collaborative reasoning tasks. Our focus is on two core properties such task-oriented protocols may exhibit: Efficiency -- conveying task-relevant information more concisely than natural language, and Covertness -- becoming difficult for external observers to interpret, raising concerns about transparency and control. To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret. We also observe spontaneous coordination between similar models without explicitly shared protocols. These findings highlight both the potential and the risks of task-oriented communication, and position referential games as a valuable testbed for future work in this area.

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constraints, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

Abstract: We present LLaTTE (LLM-Style Latent Transformers for Temporal Events), a scalable transformer architecture for production ads recommendation. Through systematic experiments, we demonstrate that sequence modeling in recommendation systems follows predictable power-law scaling similar to LLMs. Crucially, we find that semantic features bend the scaling curve: they are a prerequisite for scaling, enabling the model to effectively utilize the capacity of deeper and longer architectures. To realize the benefits of continued scaling under strict latency constraints, we introduce a two-stage architecture that offloads the heavy computation of large, long-context models to an asynchronous upstream user model. We demonstrate that upstream improvements transfer predictably to downstream ranking tasks. Deployed as the largest user model at Meta, this multi-stage framework drives a 4.3\% conversion uplift on Facebook Feed and Reels with minimal serving overhead, establishing a practical blueprint for harnessing scaling laws in industrial recommender systems.

Abstract: Interpretability in black-box dense retrievers remains a central challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Understanding how queries and documents semantically interact is critical for diagnosing retrieval behavior and improving model design. However, existing dense retrievers rely on static embeddings for both queries and documents, which obscures this bidirectional relationship. Post-hoc approaches such as re-rankers are computationally expensive, add inference latency, and still fail to reveal the underlying semantic alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Interpretable Modular Retrieval Neural Networks (IMRNNs), a lightweight framework that augments any dense retriever with dynamic, bidirectional modulation at inference time. IMRNNs employ two independent adapters: one conditions document embeddings on the current query, while the other refines the query embedding using corpus-level feedback from initially retrieved documents. This iterative modulation process enables the model to adapt representations dynamically and expose interpretable semantic dependencies between queries and documents. Empirically, IMRNNs not only enhance interpretability but also improve retrieval effectiveness. Across seven benchmark datasets, applying our method to standard dense retrievers yields average gains of +6.35% nDCG, +7.14% recall, and +7.04% MRR over state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating interpretability-driven modulation can both explain and enhance retrieval in RAG systems.

Abstract: Designing an embedding retrieval system requires navigating a complex design space of conflicting trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness. This work structures these decisions as a vertical traversal of the system design stack. We begin with the Representation Layer by examining how loss functions and architectures, specifically Bi-encoders and Cross-encoders, define semantic relevance and geometric projection. Next, we analyze the Granularity Layer and evaluate how segmentation strategies like Atomic and Hierarchical chunking mitigate information bottlenecks in long-context documents. Moving to the Orchestration Layer, we discuss methods that transcend the single-vector paradigm, including hierarchical retrieval, agentic decomposition, and multi-stage reranking pipelines to resolve capacity limitations. Finally, we address the Robustness Layer by identifying architectural mitigations for domain generalization failures, lexical blind spots, and the silent degradation of retrieval quality due to temporal drift. By categorizing these limitations and design choices, we provide a comprehensive framework for practitioners to optimize the efficiency-effectiveness frontier in modern neural search systems.

Abstract: Item indexing, which maps a large corpus of items into compact discrete representations, is critical for both discriminative and generative recommender systems, yet existing Vector Quantization (VQ)-based approaches struggle with the highly skewed and non-stationary item distributions common in streaming industry recommenders, leading to poor assignment accuracy, imbalanced cluster occupancy, and insufficient cluster separation. To address these challenges, we propose MERGE, a next-generation item indexing paradigm that adaptively constructs clusters from scratch, dynamically monitors cluster occupancy, and forms hierarchical index structures via fine-to-coarse merging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MERGE significantly improves assignment accuracy, cluster uniformity, and cluster separation compared with existing indexing methods, while online A/B tests show substantial gains in key business metrics, highlighting its potential as a foundational indexing approach for large-scale recommendation.

Abstract: Short-video recommender systems typically optimize ranking models using dense user behavioral signals, such as clicks and watch time. However, these signals are only indirect proxies of user satisfaction and often suffer from noise and bias. Recently, explicit satisfaction feedback collected through questionnaires has emerged as a high-quality direct alignment supervision, but is extremely sparse and easily overwhelmed by abundant behavioral data, making it difficult to incorporate into online recommendation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework which is towards End-to-End Alignment of user Satisfaction via Questionaire, named EASQ, to enable real-time alignment of ranking models with true user satisfaction. Specifically, we first construct an independent parameter pathway for sparse questionnaire signals by combining a multi-task architecture and a lightweight LoRA module. The multi-task design separates sparse satisfaction supervision from dense behavioral signals, preventing the former from being overwhelmed. The LoRA module pre-inject these preferences in a parameter-isolated manner, ensuring stability in the backbone while optimizing user satisfaction. Furthermore, we employ a DPO-based optimization objective tailored for online learning, which aligns the main model outputs with sparse satisfaction signals in real time. This design enables end-to-end online learning, allowing the model to continuously adapt to new questionnaire feedback while maintaining the stability and effectiveness of the backbone. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate that EASQ consistently improves user satisfaction metrics across multiple scenarios. EASQ has been successfully deployed in a production short-video recommendation system, delivering significant and stable business gains.

Abstract: The scaling law, which indicates that model performance improves with increasing dataset and model capacity, has fueled a growing trend in expanding recommendation models in both industry and academia. However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MALLOC.

Abstract: Neural ranking models (NRMs) achieve strong retrieval effectiveness, yet prior work has shown they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We revisit this robustness question with a minimal, query-aware attack that promotes a target document by inserting or substituting a single, semantically aligned word - the query center. We study heuristic and gradient-guided variants, including a white-box method that identifies influential insertion points. On TREC-DL 2019/2020 with BERT and monoT5 re-rankers, our single-word attacks achieve up to 91% success while modifying fewer than two tokens per document on average, achieving competitive rank and score boosts with far fewer edits under a comparable white-box setup to ensure fair evaluation against PRADA. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze attack sensitivity beyond aggregate success rates. Our analysis reveals a Goldilocks zone in which mid-ranked documents are most vulnerable. These findings demonstrate practical risks and motivate future defenses for robust neural ranking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for personalized product recommendations, with practitioners commonly assuming that longer user purchase histories lead to better predictions. We challenge this assumption through a systematic benchmark of four state of the art LLMs GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5-72B, and Gemini 2.5 Flash across context lengths ranging from 5 to 50 items using the REGEN dataset.
  Surprisingly, our experiments with 50 users in a within subject design reveal no significant quality improvement with increased context length. Quality scores remain flat across all conditions (0.17--0.23). Our findings have significant practical implications: practitioners can reduce inference costs by approximately 88\% by using context (5--10 items) instead of longer histories (50 items), without sacrificing recommendation quality. We also analyze latency patterns across providers and find model specific behaviors that inform deployment decisions. This work challenges the existing ``more context is better'' paradigm and provides actionable guidelines for cost effective LLM based recommendation systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion-Augmented Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval (DAI-TIR) is a promising paradigm that improves retrieval performance by generating query images via diffusion models and using them as additional ``views'' of the user's intent. However, these generative views can be incorrect because diffusion generation may introduce hallucinated visual cues that conflict with the original query text. Indeed, we empirically demonstrate that these hallucinated cues can substantially degrade DAI-TIR performance. To address this, we propose Diffusion-aware Multi-view Contrastive Learning (DMCL), a hallucination-robust training framework that casts DAI-TIR as joint optimization over representations of query intent and the target image. DMCL introduces semantic-consistency and diffusion-aware contrastive objectives to align textual and diffusion-generated query views while suppressing hallucinated query signals. This yields an encoder that acts as a semantic filter, effectively mapping hallucinated cues into a null space, improving robustness to spurious cues and better representing the user's intent. Attention visualization and geometric embedding-space analyses corroborate this filtering behavior. Across five standard benchmarks, DMCL delivers consistent improvements in multi-round Hits@10, reaching as high as 7.37\% over prior fine-tuned and zero-shot baselines, which indicates it is a general and robust training framework for DAI-TIR.

Abstract: Recent advancements in information retrieval have highlighted the potential of integrating visual and textual information, yet effective reranking for image-text documents remains challenging due to the modality gap and scarcity of aligned datasets. Meanwhile, existing approaches often rely on large models (7B to 32B parameters) with reasoning-based distillation, incurring unnecessary computational overhead while primarily focusing on textual modalities. In this paper, we propose Rank-Nexus, a multimodal image-text document reranker that performs listwise qualitative reranking on retrieved lists incorporating both images and texts. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a progressive cross-modal training strategy. We first train modalities separately: leveraging abundant text reranking data, we distill knowledge into the text branch. For images, where data is scarce, we construct distilled pairs from multimodal large language model (MLLM) captions on image retrieval benchmarks. Subsequently, we distill a joint image-text reranking dataset. Rank-Nexus achieves outstanding performance on text reranking benchmarks (TREC, BEIR) and the challenging image reranking benchmark (INQUIRE, MMDocIR), using only a lightweight 2B pretrained visual-language model. This efficient design ensures strong generalization across diverse multimodal scenarios without excessive parameters or reasoning overhead.

Abstract: Tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) known-item retrieval involves re-finding an item for which the searcher does not reliably recall an identifier. ToT information requests (or queries) are verbose and tend to include several complex phenomena, making them especially difficult for existing information retrieval systems. The TREC 2025 ToT track focused on a single ad-hoc retrieval task. This year, we extended the track to general domain and incorporated different sets of test queries from diverse sources, namely from the MS-ToT dataset, manual topic development, and LLM-based synthetic query generation. This year, 9 groups (including the track coordinators) submitted 32 runs.

Abstract: Biomedical researchers face increasing challenges in navigating millions of publications in diverse domains. Traditional search engines typically return articles as ranked text lists, offering little support for global exploration or in-depth analysis. Although recent advances in generative AI and large language models have shown promise in tasks such as summarization, extraction, and question answering, their dialog-based implementations are poorly integrated with literature search workflows. To address this gap, we introduce MedViz, a visual analytics system that integrates multiple AI agents with interactive visualization to support the exploration of the large-scale biomedical literature. MedViz combines a semantic map of millions of articles with agent-driven functions for querying, summarizing, and hypothesis generation, allowing researchers to iteratively refine questions, identify trends, and uncover hidden connections. By bridging intelligent agents with interactive visualization, MedViz transforms biomedical literature search into a dynamic, exploratory process that accelerates knowledge discovery.

Abstract: Schadenfreude, or the pleasure derived from others' misfortunes, has become a visible and performative feature of online news engagement, yet little is known about its prevalence, dynamics, or social patterning. We examine schadenfreude on Facebook over a ten-year period across nine major news publishers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and India (one left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one centrist per country). Using a combination of human annotation and machine-learning classification, we identify posts describing misfortune and detect schadenfreude in nearly one million associated comments. We find that while sadness and anger dominate reactions to misfortune posts, laughter and amusement form a substantial and patterned minority. Schadenfreude is most frequent in moralized and political contexts, higher among right-leaning audiences, and more pronounced in India than in the United States or United Kingdom. Temporal and regression analyses further reveal that schadenfreude generally increases when groups are politically out of power, but these patterns differ across party lines. Together, our findings move beyond anecdotal accounts to map schadenfreude as a dynamic, context-dependent feature of digital discourse, revealing how it evolves over time and across ideological and cultural divides.

Abstract: Link prediction is a cornerstone of the Web ecosystem, powering applications from recommendation and search to knowledge graph completion and collaboration forecasting. However, large-scale networks present unique challenges: they contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges with heterogeneous and overlapping community structures that evolve over time. Existing approaches face notable limitations: traditional graph neural networks struggle to capture global structural dependencies, while recent graph transformers achieve strong performance but incur quadratic complexity and lack interpretable latent structure. We propose \textbf{TGSBM} (Transformer-Guided Stochastic Block Model), a framework that integrates the principled generative structure of Overlapping Stochastic Block Models with the representational power of sparse Graph Transformers. TGSBM comprises three main components: (i) \emph{expander-augmented sparse attention} that enables near-linear complexity and efficient global mixing, (ii) a \emph{neural variational encoder} that infers structured posteriors over community memberships and strengths, and (iii) a \emph{neural edge decoder} that reconstructs links via OSBM's generative process, preserving interpretability. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance (mean rank 1.6 under HeaRT protocol), superior scalability (up to $6\times$ faster training), and interpretable community structures. These results position TGSBM as a practical approach that strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and transparency for large-scale link prediction.

Abstract: When deciding how to solve complex problems, it seems important not only to know whether an intervention is helpful but also to understand why. Therefore, the present study investigated whether explicit information about causal mechanisms enables people to distinguish between multiple interventions. It was hypothesised that mechanism information helps them appreciate indirect interventions that treat the root causes of a problem instead of just fixing its symptoms. This was investigated in an experimental hoof trimming scenario in which participants evaluated various interventions. To do so, they received causal diagrams with different types of causal information and levels of mechanistic detail. While detailed mechanism information and its embedding in the context of other influences made participants less sceptical towards indirect interventions, the effects were quite small. Moreover, it did not mitigate participants' robust preference for interventions that only fix a problem's symptoms. Taken together, the findings suggest that in order to help people choose sustainable interventions, it is not sufficient to make information about causal mechanisms available.

Abstract: Finding a particular object in a display is important for viewers in many visualizations, for example, when reacting to brushing or to a highlighted object. This can be enabled by making the target object different in one of the visual variables that determine the object's appearance; for example, by changing its color or size. Certain interpretations of the visual search literature have promoted the view that using visual variables such as hue-often labeled as preattentive-would make the target object automatically "popout," implying that an object can be located almost instantly, regardless of the number of objects in the display. In this paper we present a study that serves as a bridge between the extensive visual search literature and visualization, establishing empirical base measurements for the localization task. By testing displays with up to hundreds of objects, we are able to show that none of the common visual variables is immune to the increase in the number of objects. We also provide the first empirically informed comparisons between visual variables for this task in the context of visualization, and show how different visual variables have varying robustness with respect to two additional dimensions: the location of the target and the overall visual arrangement (layout).

Abstract: Programming instructors have diverse philosophies about integrating generative AI into their classes. Some encourage students to use AI, while others restrict or forbid it. Regardless of their approach, all instructors benefit from understanding how their students actually use AI while writing code. Such insight helps instructors assess whether AI use aligns with their pedagogical goals, enables timely intervention when they find unproductive usage patterns, and establishes effective policies for AI use. However, our survey with programming instructors found that many instructors lack visibility into how students use AI in their code-writing processes. To address this challenge, we introduce Editrail, an interactive system that enables instructors to track students' AI usage, create personalized assessments, and provide timely interventions, all within the workflow of monitoring coding histories. We found that Editrail enables instructors to detect AI use that conflicts with pedagogical goals accurately and to determine when and which students require intervention.

Abstract: A core assumption of Explainable AI (XAI) is that explanations are useful to users -- that is, users will do something with the explanations. Prior work, however, does not clearly connect the information provided in explanations to user actions to evaluate effectiveness. In this paper, we articulate this connection. We conducted a formative study through 14 interviews with end users in education and medicine. We contribute a catalog of information and associated actions. Our catalog maps 12 categories of information that participants described relying on to take 60 different actions. We show how AI Creators can use the catalog's specificity and breadth to articulate how they expect information in their explanations to lead to user actions and test their assumptions. We use an exemplar XAI system to illustrate this approach. We conclude by discussing how our catalog expands the design space for XAI systems to support actionability.

Abstract: Generative AI chatbots have proven surprisingly effective at persuading people to change their beliefs and attitudes in lab settings. However, the practical implications of these findings are not yet clear. In this work, we explore the impact of rehabilitative conversations with generative AI chatbots on users who share toxic content online. Toxic behaviors -- like insults or threats of violence, are widespread in online communities. Strategies to deal with toxic behavior are typically punitive, such as removing content or banning users. Rehabilitative approaches are rarely attempted, in part due to the emotional and psychological cost of engaging with aggressive users. In collaboration with seven large Reddit communities, we conducted a large-scale field experiment (N=893) to invite people who had recently posted toxic content to participate in conversations with AI chatbots. A qualitative analysis of the conversations shows that many participants engaged in good faith and even expressed remorse or a desire to change. However, we did not observe a significant change in toxic behavior in the following month compared to a control group. We discuss possible explanations for our findings, as well as theoretical and practical implications based on our results.

Abstract: People candidly discuss sensitive topics online under the perceived safety of anonymity; yet, for many, this perceived safety is tenuous, as miscalibrated risk perceptions can lead to over-disclosure. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) afford an unprecedented opportunity to present users with quantified disclosure-based re-identification risk (i.e., "population risk estimates", PREs). How can PREs be presented to users in a way that promotes informed decision-making, mitigating risk without encouraging unnecessary self-censorship? Using design fictions and comic-boarding, we story-boarded five design concepts for presenting PREs to users and evaluated them through an online survey with N = 44 Reddit users. We found participants had detailed conceptions of how PREs may impact risk awareness and motivation, but envisioned needing additional context and support to effectively interpret and act on risks. We distill our findings into four key design recommendations for how best to present users with quantified privacy risks to support informed disclosure decision-making.

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and smart home technologies, the intelligent transformation of traditional household appliances has become an inevitable trend. This paper presents AirAgent--an LLM-driven autonomous agent framework designed for home air systems. Leveraging a voice-based dialogue interface, AirAgent autonomously and personally manages indoor air quality through comprehensive perception, reasoning, and control. The framework innovatively adopts a two-layer cooperative architecture: Memory-Based Tag Extraction and Reasoning-Driven Planning. First, a dynamic memory tag extraction module continuously updates personalized user profiles. Second, a reasoning-planning model integrates real-time environmental sensor data, user states, and domain-specific prior knowledge (e.g., public health guidelines) to generate context-aware decisions. To support both interpretability and execution, we design a semi-streaming output mechanism that uses special tokens to segment the model's output stream in real time, simultaneously producing human-readable Chain-of-Thought explanations and structured, device-executable control commands. The system handles planning across 25 distinct complex dimensions while satisfying more than 20 customized constraints. As a result, AirAgent endows home air systems with proactive perception, service, and orchestration capabilities, enabling seamless, precise, and personalized air management responsive to dynamic indoor and outdoor conditions. Experimental results demonstrate up to 94.9 percent accuracy and more than 20 percent improvement in user experience metrics compared to competing commercial solutions.

Abstract: The global shortage and uneven distribution of medical expertise continue to hinder equitable access to accurate diagnostic care. While existing intelligent diagnostic system have shown promise, most struggle with dual-user interaction, and dynamic knowledge integration -- limiting their real-world applicability. In this study, we present DiagLink, a dual-user diagnostic assistance system that synergizes large language models (LLMs), knowledge graphs (KGs), and medical experts to support both patients and physicians. DiagLink uses guided dialogues to elicit patient histories, leverages LLMs and KGs for collaborative reasoning, and incorporates physician oversight for continuous knowledge validation and evolution. The system provides a role-adaptive interface, dynamically visualized history, and unified multi-source evidence to improve both trust and usability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful learning tools, but they lack awareness of learners' cognitive and physiological states, limiting their adaptability to the user's learning style. Contemporary learning techniques primarily focus on structured learning paths, knowledge tracing, and generic adaptive testing but fail to address real-time learning challenges driven by cognitive load, attention fluctuations, and engagement levels. Building on findings from a formative user study (N=66), we introduce GuideAI, a multi-modal framework that enhances LLM-driven learning by integrating real-time biosensory feedback including eye gaze tracking, heart rate variability, posture detection, and digital note-taking behavior. GuideAI dynamically adapts learning content and pacing through cognitive optimizations (adjusting complexity based on learning progress markers), physiological interventions (breathing guidance and posture correction), and attention-aware strategies (redirecting focus using gaze analysis). Additionally, GuideAI supports diverse learning modalities, including text-based, image-based, audio-based, and video-based instruction, across varied knowledge domains. A preliminary study (N = 25) assessed GuideAI's impact on knowledge retention and cognitive load through standardized assessments. The results show statistically significant improvements in both problem-solving capability and recall-based knowledge assessments. Participants also experienced notable reductions in key NASA-TLX measures including mental demand, frustration levels, and effort, while simultaneously reporting enhanced perceived performance. These findings demonstrate GuideAI's potential to bridge the gap between current LLM-based learning systems and individualized learner needs, paving the way for adaptive, cognition-aware education at scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The intersection of visualization and the humanities (VIS*H) is marked by a tension between chasing analytical "insight" and interpretive "meaning." The effectiveness of visualization techniques hinges on established evaluation frameworks that assess both analytical utility and communicative efficacy, creating a potential mismatch with the non-positivist, interpretive aims of humanities scholarship. To examine how this tension manifests in practice, we systematically surveyed 171 VIS*H design studies to analyze their evaluation workflows and rigor according to standard practice. Our findings reveal recurring flaws, such as an over-reliance on monomethod approaches, and show that higher-quality evaluations emerge from workflows that effectively triangulate diverse evidence. From these findings, we derive recommendations to refine quality and validation criteria for humanities visualizations, and juxtapose them to ongoing critical debates in the field, ultimately arguing for a paradigm shift that can reconcile the advantages of established validation techniques with the interpretive depth required for humanistic inquiry.

Abstract: We designed and evaluated an AI pilot in a planetarium visualization software, OpenSpace, for public shows in science centers. The piloting role is usually given to a human working in close collaboration with the guide on stage. We recruited 7 professional guides with extensive experience in giving shows to the public to study the impact of the AI-piloting on the overall experience. The AI-pilot is a conversational AI-agent listening to the guide and interpreting the verbal statements as commands to execute camera motions, change simulation time, or toggle visual assets. Our results show that, while AI pilots lack several critical skills for live shows, they could become useful as co-pilots to reduce workload of human pilots and allow multitasking. We propose research directions toward implementing visualization pilots and co-pilots in live settings.

Abstract: We explore how touch-sensitive spherical displays can support climate conversations in museums and science centers. These displays enable intuitive and embodied interaction with complex climate data, and support collective exploration. However, current interaction capabilities of spherical displays are limited. Therefore, this exploratory study aims to identify potential opportunities to develop meaningful interactions and technical solutions. Through two workshops, key opportunities were identified to improve visitors' understanding and navigation of climate data, along with recommendations for technical implementation. Our results provide guidelines and aspects to consider for future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Data Visualization Literacy assessments are typically administered via fixed sets of Data Visualization items, despite substantial heterogeneity in how different people interpret the same visualization. This paper presents and evaluates an approach for predicting Human Interpretation Correctness (P-HIC) of data visualizations; i.e., anticipating whether a specific person will interpret a data visualization correctly or not, before exposure to that DV, enabling more personalized assessment and training. We operationalize P-HIC as a binary classification problem using 22 features spanning Human Profile, Human Performance, and Item difficulty (including ExpertDifficulty and RaschDifficulty). We evaluate three machine-learning models (Logistic Regression model, Random Forest, Multi Layer Perceptron) with and without feature selection, using a survey with 1,083 participants who answered 32 Data Visualization items (eight data visualizations per four items), yielding 34,656 item responses. Performance is assessed via a ten-time ten-fold cross-validation in each 32 (item-specific) datasets, using AUC and Cohen's kappa. Logistic Regression model with feature selection is the best-performing approach, reaching a median AUC of 0.72 and a median kappa of 0.32. Feature analyses show RaschDifficulty as the dominant predictor, followed by experts' ratings and prior correctness (PercCorrect), whose relevance increases across sessions. Profile information did not particularly support P-HIC. Our results support the feasibility of anticipating misinterpretations of data visualizations, and motivate the runtime selection of data visualizations items tailored to an audience, thereby improving the efficiency of Data Visualization Literacy assessment and targeted training.

Abstract: Sketching provides an intuitive way to convey dynamic intent in animation authoring (i.e., how elements change over time and space), making it a natural medium for automatic content creation. Yet existing approaches often constrain sketches to fixed command tokens or predefined visual forms, overlooking their freeform nature and the central role of humans in shaping intention. To address this, we introduce an interaction paradigm where users convey dynamic intent to a vision-language model via free-form sketching, instantiated here in a sketch storyboard to motion graphics workflow. We implement an interface and improve it through a three-stage study with 24 participants. The study shows how sketches convey motion with minimal input, how their inherent ambiguity requires users to be involved for clarification, and how sketches can visually guide video refinement. Our findings reveal the potential of sketch and AI interaction to bridge the gap between intention and outcome, and demonstrate its applicability to 3D animation and video generation.

Abstract: Accurate neuronavigation is essential for generating the intended effect with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Precise coil placement also directly influences stimulation efficacy. Traditional neuronavigation systems often rely on costly and still hard to use and error-prone tracking systems. To solve these limitations, we present a computer-vision-based neuronavigation system for real-time tracking of patient and TMS instrumentation. The system can feed the necessary data for a digital twin to track TMS stimulation targets. We integrate a self-coordinating optical tracking system with multiple consumer-grade cameras and visible tags with a dynamic 3D brain model in Unity. This model updates in real time to represent the current stimulation coil position and the estimated stimulation point to intuitively visualize neural targets for clinicians. We incorporate an augmented reality (AR) module to bridge the gap between the visualization of the digital twin and the real world and project the brain model in real-time onto the head of a patient. AR headsets or mobile AR devices allow clinicians to interactively view and adjust the placement of the stimulation transducer intuitively instead of guidance through abstract numbers and 6D cross hairs on an external screen. The proposed technique provides improved spatial precision as well as accuracy. A case study with ten participants with a medical background also demonstrates that the system has high usability.

Abstract: As conversational agents become increasingly common in behaviour change interventions, understanding optimal feedback delivery mechanisms becomes increasingly important. However, choosing a style that both lessens psychological reactance (perceived threats to freedom) while simultaneously eliciting feelings of surprise and engagement represents a complex design problem. We explored how three different feedback styles: 'Direct', 'Politeness', and 'Verbal Leakage' (slips or disfluencies to reveal a desired behaviour) affect user perceptions and behavioural intentions. Matching expectations from literature, the 'Direct' chatbot led to lower behavioural intentions and higher reactance, while the 'Politeness' chatbot evoked higher behavioural intentions and lower reactance. However, 'Politeness' was also seen as unsurprising and unengaging by participants. In contrast, 'Verbal Leakage' evoked reactance, yet also elicited higher feelings of surprise, engagement, and humour. These findings highlight that effective feedback requires navigating trade-offs between user reactance and engagement, with novel approaches such as 'Verbal Leakage' offering promising alternative design opportunities.

Abstract: Family learning takes place in everyday routines where children and caregivers read, practice, and develop new skills together. Despite growing interest in AI tutors, most existing systems are designed for single learners or classroom settings and do not address the distributed planning, coordination, and execution demands of learning at home. This paper introduces ParPal, a human-centred, LLM-powered system that supports multi-actor family learning by decomposing learning goals into actionable subtasks, allocating them across caregivers under realistic availability and expertise constraints, and providing caregiver-in-the-loop tutoring support with visibility into individual and collective contributions. Through expert evaluation of generated weekly learning plans and a one-week field deployment with 11 families, we identify systematic failure modes in current LLM-based planning, including misalignment with role expertise, unnecessary or costly collaboration, missing pedagogical learning trajectories, and physically or temporally infeasible tasks. While ParPal improves coordination clarity and recognition of caregiving effort, these findings expose fundamental limitations in how current LLMs operationalize pedagogical knowledge, reason about collaboration, and account for real-world, embodied constraints. We discuss implications for human-centred AI design and AI methodology, positioning multi-actor family learning as a critical testbed for advancing planning, adaptation, and pedagogical structure in next-generation AI systems.

Abstract: How do students develop AI literacy through everyday practice rather than formal instruction? While normative AI literacy frameworks proliferate, empirical understanding of how students actually learn to work with generative AI remains limited. This study analyzes 10,536 ChatGPT messages from 36 undergraduates over one academic year, revealing five use genres -- academic workhorse, emotional companion, metacognitive partner, repair and negotiation, and trust calibration -- that constitute distinct configurations of student-AI learning. Drawing on domestication theory and emerging frameworks for AI literacy, we demonstrate that functional AI competence emerges through ongoing relational negotiation rather than one-time adoption. Students develop sophisticated genre portfolios, strategically matching interaction patterns to learning needs while exercising critical judgment about AI limitations. Notably, repair work during AI breakdowns produces substantial learning about AI capabilities, developing what we term "repair literacy" -- a crucial but underexplored dimension of AI competence. Our findings offer educators empirically grounded insights into how students actually learn to work with generative AI, with implications for AI literacy pedagogy, responsible AI integration, and the design of AI-enabled learning environments that support student agency.

Abstract: We present ScaleFree, a GPU-accelerated adaptive Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) algorithm for scalable, interactive multiscale point cloud exploration. With this technique, we cater to the massive datasets and complex multiscale structures in advanced scientific computing, such as cosmological simulations with billions of particles. Effective exploration of such data requires a full 3D understanding of spatial structures, a capability for which immersive environments such as VR are particularly well suited. However, simultaneously supporting global multiscale context and fine-grained local detail remains a significant challenge. A key difficulty lies in dynamically generating continuous density fields from point clouds to facilitate the seamless scale transitions: while KDE is widely used, precomputed fields restrict the accuracy of interaction and omit fine-scale structures, while dynamic computation is often too costly for real-time VR interaction. We address this challenge by leveraging GPU acceleration with k-d-tree-based spatial queries and parallel reduction within a thread group for on-the-fly density estimation. With this approach, we can recalculate scalar fields dynamically as users shift their focus across scales. We demonstrate the benefits of adaptive density estimation through two data exploration tasks: adaptive selection and progressive navigation. Through performance experiments, we demonstrate that ScaleFree with GPU-parallel implementation achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over sequential and multi-core CPU baselines. In a controlled experiment, we further confirm that our adaptive selection technique improves accuracy and efficiency in multiscale selection tasks.

Abstract: Re-inforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been effective in the task of AI alignment. However, one of the key assumptions of RLHF is that the annotators (referred to as workers from here on out) have a homogeneous response space. This assumption is not true in most practical settings and there have been studies done in the past to challenge this notion. This work has been inspired by such studies and explores one of the ways to deal with heterogeneity in worker preferences - by clustering workers with similar preferences and personalising reward models for each cluster. This work provides an algorithm that encourages simultaneous learning of reward models and worker embeddings. This algorithm is then empirically tested against the Reddit TL;DR dataset with unique worker IDs. We have shown that clustering users into different groups based on their preferences and created personalised reward models improves win-rate of the said models. Along with results and visualisations, this work aims to act as a stepping stone to more complicated models and gives a list of possible future extensions.
