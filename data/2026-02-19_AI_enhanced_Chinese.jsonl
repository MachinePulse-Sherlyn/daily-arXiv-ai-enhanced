Recently, large language model (LLM)-based recommendation models have demonstrated impressive performance by leveraging LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge. However, adopting LLM-based recommendation models in Federated CDR scenarios introduces new challenges. First, there exists a risk of overfitting with domain-specific local adapters. The magnitudes of locally optimized parameter updates often vary across domains, causing biased aggregation and overfitting toward domain-specific distributions. Second, unlike traditional recommendation models (e.g., collaborative filtering, bipartite graph-based methods) that learn explicit and comparable user/item representations, LLMs encode knowledge implicitly through autoregressive text generation training. This poses additional challenges for effectively measuring the cross-domain similarities under heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based framework for federated cross-domain recommendation, FeDecider. Specifically, FeDecider tackles the challenge of scale-specific noise by disentangling each client's low-rank updates and sharing only their directional components. To handle the need for flexible and effective integration, each client further learns personalized weights that achieve the data-aware integration of updates from other domains. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed FeDecider.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this stage, candidate items are indexed using their learned embedding vectors, and ANN search is executed for each user (or item) query to retrieve a set of relevant items. However, ANN-based retrieval has two key limitations. First, item embeddings and their indices are typically learned in separate stages: indexing is often performed offline after embeddings are trained, which can yield suboptimal retrieval quality-especially for newly created items. Second, although ANN offers sublinear query time, it must still be run for every request, incurring substantial computation cost at industry scale. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Learnable Index (MFLI), a scalable, real-time retrieval paradigm that learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a unified framework and eliminates ANN search at serving time. Specifically, we construct a multifaceted hierarchical codebook via residual quantization of item embeddings and co-train the codebook with the embeddings. We further introduce an efficient multifaceted indexing structure and mechanisms that support real-time updates. At serving time, the learned hierarchical indices are used directly to identify relevant items, avoiding ANN search altogether. Extensive experiments on real-world data with billions of users show that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8\\%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29\\%, and semantic relevance by 13.5\\% compared with prior state-of-the-art methods.

Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios.

Fairness-aware community detection seeks to prevent biased node partitions, typically framed in terms of individual fairness, which requires similar nodes to be treated similarly, and group fairness, which aims to avoid disadvantaging specific groups of nodes. While existing literature on fair community detection has primarily focused on group fairness, we introduce a novel measure to quantify individual fairness in community detection methods. The proposed measure captures unfairness as the vectorial distance between a node's true and predicted community representations, computed using the community co-occurrence matrix. We provide a comprehensive empirical investigation of a broad set of community detection algorithms from the literature on both synthetic networks, with varying levels of community explicitness, and real-world networks. We particularly investigate the fairness-performance trade-off using standard quality metrics and compare individual fairness outcomes with existing group fairness measures. The results show that individual unfairness can occur even when group fairness or clustering accuracy is high, underscoring that individual and group fairness are not interchangeable. Moreover, fairness depends critically on the detectability of community structure. However, we find that Significance and Surprise for denser graphs, and Combo, Leiden, and SBMDL for sparser graphs result in a better trade-off between individual fairness and community quality.

Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.\n  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.\n  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation.

Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates.

We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas.

We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior.

However, existing research lacks systematic tools for jointly capturing engagement across help-seeking and response-use, limiting the analysis of such reliance behaviors. We introduce RelianceScope, an analytical framework that characterizes students' reliance on chatbots during problem-solving. RelianceScope (1) operationalizes reliance into nine patterns based on combinations of engagement modes in help-seeking and response-use, and (2) situates these patterns within a knowledge-context lens that accounts for students' prior knowledge and the instructional significance of knowledge components. Rather than prescribing optimal AI use, the framework enables fine-grained analysis of reliance in open-ended student-AI interactions. As an illustrative application, we applied RelianceScope to analyze chat and code-edit logs from 79 college students in a web programming course. Results show that active help-seeking is associated with active response-use, whereas reliance patterns remain similar across knowledge mastery levels.

Yet prolonged use has also been linked to distraction, fatigue, and lower mood. This paradox remains poorly understood, in part because prior studies rely on habitual or one-shot reports that ask participants to directly attribute flow to social media. To address this gap, we conducted a five-day field study with 40 participants, combining objective smartphone app tracking with daily reconstructions of flow-inducing activities. Across 673 reported flow occurrences, participants rarely associated flow with social media (2 percent). Instead, heavier social media use predicted fewer daily flow occurrences. We further examine this relationship through the effects of social media use on fatigue, mood, and motivation. Altogether, our findings suggest that flow and social media may not align as closely as assumed - and might even compete - underscoring the need for further research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

One promising solution is automated detection tools, many of which are developed within academia. We interviewed nine experienced practitioners working within or alongside regulatory bodies to understand their work against deceptive design patterns, including the use of supporting tools and the prospect of automation. Computing technologies have their place in regulatory practice, but not as envisioned in research. For example, investigations require utmost transparency and accountability in all the activities we identify as accompanying dark pattern detection, which many existing tools cannot provide. Moreover, tools need to map interfaces to legal violations to be of use. We thus recommend conducting user requirement research to maximize research impact, supporting ancillary activities beyond detection, and establishing practical tech adoption pathways that account for the needs of both scientific and regulatory activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a design framework that embeds light break activities into media content on AR smart glasses, balancing engagement and recovery. The framework employs three strategies: (1) seamlessly guiding users by embedding activity cues aligned with media elements; (2) transitioning to audio-centric formats to reduce visual load while sustaining immersion; and (3) structuring sessions with \"rise-peak-closure\" pacing for smooth transitions. In a within-subjects study (N = 16) comparing passive viewing, reminder-based breaks, and non-narrative activities, InteractiveBreak instantiated from our framework seamlessly guided activities, sustained engagement, and enhanced break quality.

While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
