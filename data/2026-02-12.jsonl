In particular, existing solutions excel either at specific filter categories (e.g., label equality) or within narrow selectivity bands (e.g., pre-filtering for low selectivity) and are therefore a poor fit for practical deployments that demand generalization to new filter types and unknown query selectivities. In this paper, we propose JAG (Joint Attribute Graphs), a graph-based algorithm designed to deliver robust performance across the entire selectivity spectrum and support diverse filter types. Our key innovation is the introduction of attribute and filter distances, which transform binary filter constraints into continuous navigational guidance. By constructing a proximity graph that jointly optimizes for both vector similarity and attribute proximity, JAG prevents navigational dead-ends and allows JAG to consistently outperform prior graph-based filtered nearest neighbor search methods. Our experimental results across five datasets and four filter types (Label, Range, Subset, Boolean) demonstrate that JAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in both throughput and recall robustness."}

To address these challenges, we are motivated to adopt a query-centric formulation that projects cross-modal and cross-page information into a unified query representation space, with queries acting as abstract semantic surrogates for heterogeneous multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation (MLDocRAG) framework that leverages a Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) to organize multimodal document content around semantically rich, answerable queries. MCQG is constructed via a multimodal document expansion process that generates fine-grained queries from heterogeneous document chunks and links them to their corresponding content across modalities and pages. This graph-based structure enables selective, query-centric retrieval and structured evidence aggregation, thereby enhancing grounding and coherence in long-context multimodal question answering. Experiments on datasets MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL demonstrate that MLDocRAG consistently improves retrieval quality and answer accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for long-context multimodal understanding."}

This method is particularly effective where standard Pseudo-Relevance Feedback fails due to poor initial recall. Crucially, our LLM is not fine-tuned for ToT or specific domains, demonstrating that gains stem from our prompting strategy rather than model specialization. Rewritten queries feed a multi-stage pipeline: sparse retrieval (BM25), dense/late-interaction reranking (Contriever, E5-large-v2, ColBERTv2), monoT5 cross-encoding, and list-wise reranking (Qwen 2.5 72B).

To this end, we propose GeoGR, a geographic generative recommendation framework tailored for navigation-based LBS like AMAP, which perceives users' contextual state changes and enables intent-aware POI recommendation. GeoGR features a two-stage design: (i) a geo-aware SID tokenization pipeline that explicitly learns spatio-temporal collaborative semantic representations via geographically constrained co-visited POI pairs, contrastive learning, and iterative refinement; and (ii) a multi-stage LLM training strategy that aligns non-native SID tokens through multiple template-based continued pre-training(CPT) and enables autoregressive POI generation via supervised fine-tuning(SFT).

We introduce the AI-Assisted Critical Thinking (AACT) framework, which leverages a domain-specific AI model's counterfactual analysis of human decision to help decision-makers identify potential flaws in their decision argument and support the correction of them. Through a case study on house price prediction, we find that AACT outperforms traditional AI-based decision-support in reducing over-reliance on AI, though also triggering higher cognitive load. Subgroup analysis reveals AACT can be particularly beneficial for some decision-makers such as those very familiar with AI technologies.

This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline."}

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints."}

To understand the behavior of AI agents in the agent-native community, in this paper, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Moltbook leveraging a dataset of 44,411 posts and 12,209 sub-communities (\"submolts\") collected prior to February 1, 2026. Leveraging a topic taxonomy with nine content categories and a five-level toxicity scale, we systematically analyze the topics and risks of agent discussions. Our analysis answers three questions: what topics do agents discuss (RQ1), how risk varies by topic (RQ2), and how topics and toxicity evolve over time (RQ3). We find that Moltbook exhibits explosive growth and rapid diversification, moving beyond early social interaction into viewpoint, incentive-driven, promotional, and political discourse. The attention of agents increasingly concentrates in centralized hubs and around polarizing, platform-native narratives. Toxicity is strongly topic-dependent: incentive- and governance-centric categories contribute a disproportionate share of risky content, including religion-like coordination rhetoric and anti-humanity ideology. Moreover, bursty automation by a small number of agents can produce flooding at sub-minute intervals, distorting discourse and stressing platform stability.

While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems."}

Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences.

An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions."}

Existing models, such as clique, k-plex, and γ-quasi-clique, use fixed density thresholds that overlook the natural decay of connectivity as the subgraph size increases. The Flexi-clique model overcomes this limitation by imposing a degree constraint that grows sub-linearly with subgraph size. We provide the algorithmic study of Flexi-clique, proving its NP-hardness and analysing its non-hereditary properties. To address its computational challenge, we propose the Flexi-Prune Algorithm FPA, a fast heuristic using core-based seeding and connectivity-aware pruning, and the Efficient Branch-and-Bound Algorithm EBA, an exact framework enhanced with multiple pruning rules. Experiments on large real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that FPA achieves near-optimal quality at much lower cost, while EBA efficiently computes exact solutions. Flexi-clique thus provides a practical and scalable model for discovering large, meaningful subgraphs in complex networks."}

However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present \\textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign--PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78--90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall."}

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer rich semantic priors that could supply such supervision, direct adoption in industrial recommendation is hindered by two obstacles: semantic signals can conflict with platform business objectives, and LLM inference is prohibitively expensive at scale. This paper presents S-GRec, a semantic-aware framework that decouples an online lightweight generator from an offline LLM-based semantic judge for train-time supervision. S-GRec introduces a two-stage Personalized Semantic Judge (PSJ) that produces interpretable aspect evidence and learns user-conditional aggregation from pairwise feedback, yielding stable semantic rewards. To prevent semantic supervision from deviating from business goals, Asymmetric Advantage Policy Optimization (A2PO) anchors optimization on business rewards (e.g., eCPM) and injects semantic advantages only when they are consistent. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale production system validate both effectiveness and scalability, including statistically significant gains in CTR and a 1.19\\% lift in GMV in online A/B tests, without requiring real-time LLM inference."}

This extended study introduces a comprehensive, multimodal physiological framework for non-invasive hypoglycemia detection using wearable sensor signals. Unlike prior work limited to single-signal analysis, this chapter evaluates three physiological modalities, galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and their combined fusion, using the OhioT1DM 2018 dataset. We develop an end-to-end pipeline that integrates advanced preprocessing, temporal windowing, handcrafted and sequence-based feature extraction, early and late fusion strategies, and a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep temporal models, including CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and TCNs. Our results demonstrate that physiological signals exhibit distinct autonomic patterns preceding hypoglycemia and that combining GSR with HR consistently enhances detection sensitivity and stability compared to single-signal models. Multimodal deep learning architectures achieve the most reliable performance, particularly in recall, the most clinically urgent metric. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary contributions of each modality, strengthening the case for affordable, sensor-based glycemic monitoring. The findings show that real-time hypoglycemia detection is achievable using only inexpensive, non-invasive wearable sensors, offering a pathway toward accessible glucose monitoring in underserved communities and low-resource healthcare environments."}

Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions.

Existing black-box extraction attacks primarily rely on hard labels or pairwise learning, often ignoring the importance of ranking positions, which results in incomplete knowledge transfer. Moreover, adversarial sequences generated via pure gradient methods lack semantic consistency with real user behavior, making them easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-enhanced attack framework. First, drawing on primacy effects and position bias, we introduce a cognitive distribution-driven extraction mechanism that maps discrete rankings into continuous value distributions with position-aware decay, thereby advancing from order alignment to cognitive distribution alignment. Second, we design a behavior-aware noisy item generation strategy that jointly optimizes collaborative signals and gradient signals. This ensures both semantic coherence and statistical stealth while effectively promoting target item rankings. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack success rate and evasion rate, validating the value of integrating cognitive modeling and behavioral consistency for secure recommender systems."}

Traditional methods for muscle activation sensing rely on specialized electrodes, such as surface electromyography, making them impractical, especially for long-term usage. In this paper, we introduce Press2Muscle, the first system to unobtrusively infer muscle activation using insole pressure sensors. The key idea is to analyze foot pressure changes resulting from full-body muscle activation that drives movements. To handle variations in pressure signals due to differences in users' gait, weight, and movement styles, we propose a data-driven approach to dynamically adjust reliance on different foot regions and incorporate easily accessible biographical data to enhance Press2Muscle's generalization to unseen users. We conducted an extensive study with 30 users. Under a leave-one-user-out setting, Press2Muscle achieves a root mean square error of 0.025, marking a 19% improvement over a video-based counterpart. A robustness study validates Press2Muscle's ability to generalize across user demographics, footwear types, and walking surfaces. Additionally, we showcase muscle imbalance detection and muscle activation estimation under free-living settings with Press2Muscle, confirming the feasibility of muscle activation sensing using insole pressure sensors in real-world settings."}

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods."}

Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale. Deployed on Taobao's display advertising platform, EST significantly outperforms production baselines, delivering a 3.27\\% RPM (Revenue Per Mile) increase and a 1.22\\% CTR lift, establishing a practical pathway for scalable industrial CTR prediction models."}

Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces.

However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called \"source bias\", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers."}

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions.

Our findings suggest that participants were able to significantly differentiate female agents by personality, while male agents were not consistently distinguished. We also observed evidence of personality synchrony, where participants tended to perceive the first agent as more similar to their own personality, with this effect driven mainly by male participants, especially toward male agents.

GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance."}

We examine HCI literature on labor, investigating focal themes and conceptual, empirical, and design approaches. Drawing from LPT, we offer directions for HCI research and practice: distinguish labor from work, link work practice to value production, study up the management, analyze consent and legitimacy, move beyond the point of production, design alternative institutions, and unnaturalize bourgeois designs. These directions can deepen analyses of tech-mediated workplace regimes, inform critical and normative designs, and strengthen the field's connection to broader political economic critique."}

We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities."}

However, the choice of input device and its visualization might influence workload and thus user performance leading to suboptimal demonstrations or reduced training effects. This study investigates how different VR input configurations - motion capture gloves, controllers with hand visualization, and controllers with controller visualization - affect user experience and task execution, with the goal of identifying which configuration is best suited for which type of task. Participants performed various kitchen-related activities of daily living (ADLs), including object placement, cutting, cleaning, and pouring in a simulated environment. To address two research questions, we evaluated user experience using the System Usability Scale and NASA Task Load Index (RQ1), and task-specific interaction behavior (RQ2). The latter was assessed using trajectory segmentation, analyzing movement efficiency, unnecessary actions, and execution precision. While no significant differences in overall usability and workload were found, trajectory analysis revealed configuration-specific execution behaviors with different movement strategies. Controllers enabled significantly faster task completion with less movement variability in pick-and-place style tasks such as table setting. In contrast, motion capture gloves produced more natural movements with fewer unnecessary actions, but also showed greater variance in movement patterns for manner-oriented tasks such as cutting bread. These findings highlight trade-offs between efficiency and naturalism, and have implications for optimizing VR-based training, improving the quality of user-generated demonstrations, and tailoring interaction design to specific application goals."}

This study examines six conversational LLM platforms, analyzing how they define and implement features for users to access, edit, delete, and share data. Our analysis reveals an emerging paradigm of data control in conversational LLM platforms, where user data is generated and derived through interaction itself, natural language enables flexible yet often ambiguous control, and multi-user interactions with shared data raise questions of co-ownership and governance.

In safety-critical tasks, human oversight of these systems is required to mitigate risks and to ensure responsibility in case something goes wrong. Since people often struggle to stay focused and perform good oversight, intelligent support systems are used to assist them, giving decision recommendations, alerting users, or restricting them from dangerous actions. However, in cases where recommendations are wrong, decision support might undermine the very reason why human oversight was employed -- genuine moral responsibility. The goal of our study was to investigate how a decision support system that restricted available interventions would affect overseer's perceived moral responsibility, in particular in cases where the support errs. In a simulated oversight experiment, participants (\\textit{N}=274) monitored an autonomous drone that faced ten critical situations, choosing from six possible actions to resolve each situation. An AI system constrained participants' choices to either six, four, two, or only one option (between-subject study). Results showed that participants, who were restricted to choosing from a single action, felt less morally responsible if a crash occurred. At the same time, participants' judgments about the responsibility of other stakeholders (the AI; the developer of the AI) did not change between conditions. Our findings provide important insights for user interface design and oversight architectures: they should prevent users from attributing moral agency to AI, help them understand how moral responsibility is distributed, and, when oversight aims to prevent ethically undesirable outcomes, be designed to support the epistemic and causal conditions required for moral responsibility."}

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications."}

To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets."}

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%.

We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs. These results reframe fact-checking as a demand-driven problem and identify where current AI systems and benchmarks are misaligned with the uncertainty people actually experience."}

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement."}

We find that Moltbook exhibits explosive growth and rapid diversification, moving beyond early social interaction into viewpoint, incentive-driven, promotional, and political discourse. The attention of agents increasingly concentrates in centralized hubs and around polarizing, platform-native narratives. Toxicity is strongly topic-dependent: incentive- and governance-centric categories contribute a disproportionate share of risky content, including religion-like coordination rhetoric and anti-humanity ideology. Moreover, bursty automation by a small number of agents can produce flooding at sub-minute intervals, distorting discourse and stressing platform stability.

It enables researchers from varying disciplines to orchestrate end-to-end experimental workflows that integrate consent and background surveys, chat-based and search-based information-seeking sessions, writing or judgment tasks, and pre- and post-task evaluations within a unified, low-coding-load framework. ECHO logs fine-grained interaction traces and participant responses, and exports structured datasets for downstream analysis. By supporting both chat and search alongside flexible evaluation instruments, ECHO lowers technical barriers for studying learning, decision making, and user experience across different information access paradigms, empowering researchers from information retrieval, HCI, and the social sciences to conduct scalable and reproducible human-centered AI evaluations."}

This is the accepted author version", "summary": "AI technologies that sense student attention and emotions to enable more personalised teaching interventions are increasingly promoted, but raise pressing questions about student learning, well-being, and ethics. In particular, students' perspectives about AI sensing-intervention in learning are often overlooked. We conducted an online mixed-method experiment with Australian university students (N=132), presenting video scenarios varying by whether sensing was used (in-use vs. not-in-use), sensing modality (gaze-based attention detection vs. facial-based emotion detection), and intervention (by digital device vs. teacher). Participants also completed pairwise ranking tasks to prioritise six core ethical concerns. Findings revealed that students valued targeted intervention but responded negatively to AI monitoring, regardless of sensing methods. Students preferred system-generated hints over teacher-initiated assistance, citing learning agency and social embarrassment concerns. Students' ethical considerations prioritised autonomy and privacy, followed by transparency, accuracy, fairness, and learning beneficence. We advocate designing customisable, social-sensitive, non-intrusive systems that preserve student control, agency, and well-being."}

Griffiths", "Ilia Sucholutsky", "Nori Jacoby"], "title": "Why Human Guidance Matters in Collaborative Vibe Coding", "comment": null, "summary": "Writing code has been one of the most transformative ways for human societies to translate abstract ideas into tangible technologies. Modern AI is transforming this process by enabling experts and non-experts alike to generate code without actually writing code, but instead, through natural language instructions, or \"vibe coding\". While increasingly popular, the cumulative impact of vibe coding on productivity and collaboration, as well as the role of humans in this process, remains unclear. Here, we introduce a controlled experimental framework for studying collaborative vibe coding and use it to compare human-led, AI-led, and hybrid groups. Across 16 experiments involving 604 human participants, we show that people provide uniquely effective high-level instructions for vibe coding across iterations, whereas AI-provided instructions often result in performance collapse. We further demonstrate that hybrid systems perform best when humans retain directional control (providing the instructions), while evaluation is delegated to AI."}

Dennig", "Michael Behrisch", "Alexandru Telea"], "title": "LCIP: Loss-Controlled Inverse Projection of High-Dimensional Image Data", "comment": null, "summary": "Projections (or dimensionality reduction) methods $P$ aim to map high-dimensional data to typically 2D scatterplots for visual exploration. Inverse projection methods $P^{-1}$ aim to map this 2D space to the data space to support tasks such as data augmentation, classifier analysis, and data imputation. Current $P^{-1}$ methods suffer from a fundamental limitation -- they can only generate a fixed surface-like structure in data space, which poorly covers the richness of this space. We address this by a new method that can `sweep' the data space under user control. Our method works generically for any $P$ technique and dataset, is controlled by two intuitive user-set parameters, and is simple to implement. We demonstrate it by an extensive application involving image manipulation for style transfer."}

A basic demand-side question remains unanswered. When ordinary people can fact-check anything they want, what do they actually ask about? We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs. These results reframe fact-checking as a demand-driven problem and identify where current AI systems and benchmarks are misaligned with the uncertainty people actually experience."}

While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions."}
