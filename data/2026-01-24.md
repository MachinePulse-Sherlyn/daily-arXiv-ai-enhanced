Abstract: Testing conversational AI systems at scale across diverse domains necessitates realistic and diverse user interactions capturing a wide array of behavioral patterns. We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains.

Abstract: Independent navigation is a core aspect of maintaining social participation and individual health for vulnerable populations. While historic cities such as Edinburgh, as the capital of Scotland, often feature well-established public transport systems, urban accessibility challenges remain and are exacerbated by a complex landscape, especially for groups with multiple vulnerabilities such as the blind elderly. With limited research examining how real-time data feeds and developments in artificial intelligence can enhance navigation aids, we address this gap through a mixed-methods approach. Our work combines statistical and machine learning techniques, with a focus on spatial analysis to investigate network coverage, service patterns, and density through live Transport for Edinburgh data, with a qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the mentioned target group. The results demonstrate the highly centralised nature of the city's transport system, the significance of memory-based navigation, and the lack of travel information in usable formats. We also find that participants already use navigation technology to varying degrees and express a willingness to adopt artificial intelligence. Our analysis highlights the importance of dynamic tools in terms of sensory and cognitive needs to meaningfully improve independent travel.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diabetes is a significant and continuously rising health challenge in Indonesia. Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as "black boxes," lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate.

Abstract: Institutional and social barriers in higher education often prevent students with disabilities from effectively accessing support, including lengthy procedures, insufficient information, and high social-emotional demands. This study empirically explores how disabled students perceive robot-based support, comparing two interaction roles, one information based (signposting) and one disclosure based (sounding board), and two embodiment types (physical robot/disembodied voice agent). Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy. We also analyse differences between disability types. These results provide critical insights into the potential of social robots to mitigate accessibility barriers in higher education, while highlighting ethical, social and technical challenges.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Mathematical knowledge exists in many forms, ranging from informal textbooks and lecture notes to large formal proof libraries, yet moving between these representations remains difficult. Informal texts hide dependencies, while formal systems expose every detail in ways that are not always human-readable. Dependency graphs offer a middle ground by making visible the structure of results, definitions, and proofs. We present KnowTeX, a standalone, user-friendly tool that extends the ideas of Lean's Blueprints, enabling the visualization of conceptual dependencies directly from LaTeX sources. Using a simple "uses" command, KnowTeX extracts relationships among statements and generates previewable graphs in DOT and TikZ formats. Applied to mathematical texts, such graphs clarify core results, support education and formalization, and provide a resource for aligning informal and formal mathematical representations. We argue that dependency graphs should become a standard feature of mathematical writing, benefiting both human readers and automated systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Interactive narrative (IN) authors craft spaces of divergent narrative possibilities for players to explore, with the player's input determining which narrative possibilities they actually experience. Generative AI can enable new forms of IN by improvisationally expanding on pre-authored content in response to open-ended player input. However, this extrapolation risks widening the gap between author-envisioned and player-experienced stories, potentially limiting the strength of plot progression and the communication of the author's narrative intent. To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces.

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, provides immersive and interactive experiences across diverse applications, from VR-based education to AR-based assistance and MR-based training. However, widespread XR adoption remains limited due to two key challenges: 1) the high cost and complexity of authoring 3D content, especially for large-scale environments or complex interactions; and 2) the steep learning curve associated with non-intuitive interaction methods like handheld controllers or scripted gestures. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a promising solution by enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction and automating content generation. Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion-based generation, GenAI can interpret ambiguous instructions, understand physical scenes, and generate or manipulate 3D content, significantly lowering barriers to XR adoption. This paper explores the integration of XR and GenAI through three concrete use cases, showing how they address key obstacles in scalability and natural interaction, and identifying technical challenges that must be resolved to enable broader adoption.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Natural-language-to-visualization (NL2VIS) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved the accessibility of data visualization. However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.
  We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.
  We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.
  The code and evaluation artifacts are available at https://zenodo.org/records/17062309.

Abstract: Mental health concerns are rising globally, prompting increased reliance on technology to address the demand-supply gap in mental health services. In particular, mental health chatbots are emerging as a promising solution, but these remain largely untested, raising concerns about safety and potential harms. In this paper, we dive into the literature to identify critical gaps in the design and implementation of mental health chatbots. We contribute an operational checklist to help guide the development and design of more trustworthy, safe, and user-friendly chatbots. The checklist serves as both a developmental framework and an auditing tool to ensure ethical and effective chatbot design. We discuss how this checklist is a step towards supporting more responsible design practices and supporting new standards for sociotechnically sound digital mental health tools.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer potential support for autistic people, but this potential requires understanding the implicit perspectives these models might carry, including their biases and assumptions about autism. Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.

Abstract: Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) is a critical method for generating deep interpretive insights. Yet its core tenets, including researcher reflexivity, tangible analytical evolution, and productive disagreement, are often poorly supported by software tools that prioritize speed and consensus over interpretive depth. To address this gap, we introduce Reflexis, a collaborative workspace that centers these practices. It supports reflexivity by integrating in-situ reflection prompts, makes code evolution transparent and tangible, and scaffolds collaborative interpretation by turning differences into productive, positionality-aware dialogue. Results from our paired-analyst study (N=12) indicate that Reflexis encouraged participants toward more granular reflection and reframed disagreements as productive conversations. The evaluation also surfaced key design tensions, including a desire for higher-level, networked memos and more user control over the timing of proactive alerts. Reflexis contributes a design framework for tools that prioritize rigor and transparency to support deep, collaborative interpretation in an age of automation.

Abstract: As digital tools increasingly mediate mental health care, self-clone chatbots can offer a uniquely novel approach to intra-personal exploration and self-derived support. Trained to replicate users' conversational patterns, self-clones allow users to talk to themselves through their digital replicas. Despite the promises, these systems may carry risks around identity confusion, negative reinforcement, and blurred user agency. Through interviews with 16 mental health professionals and 6 general users, we aim to uncover tensions and design opportunities in this emerging space to guide responsible self-clone design. Our analysis produces a design framework organized around three priorities: (1) defining goals and grounding the approach in existing therapeutic models, (2) design dimensions including the self-clone persona and user-clone relationship dynamics, and (3) considerations for minimizing potential emotional and ethical harms. This framework contributes an interdisciplinary foundation for designing self-clone chatbots as AI-mediated self-interaction tools that are emotionally and ethically attuned in mental health contexts.

Abstract: It is obvious that emotions are causal variables of motivation, as they elicit states, forces and energies that trigger and guide labor behavior. Thus, a motivational tension that is not informed by needs alone, but also by emotions, intention, goals and means to achieve them is therefore generated within the mental, emotional and physical plane. Based on Montserrat's opinion (2004: 131), that "to motivate means, above all, to move and to transmit an emotion", we will undertake to identify the mutual influences between emotions and motivation. The main objectives of this article are to display a summary of the theories and definitions about emotions and to explore the links between emotions and motivation. Although interconnected, emotions and motivation can be contemplated from a double perspective: (1) emotions influence motivation and (2) motivation influences emotions. Moreover, we will consider motivation from three dimensions: (1) cognitive, (2) affective and (3) volitional. The ultimate purpose of this article is to issue a warning as to the importance of the emotional side of motivation. An important part in implementing such insight is to be played by managers (and by employees, also), who should develop the skills and know-how needed to keep a well-balanced emotional climate that effectively favors the maximization of individual and group motivation at the workplace.

Abstract: We present a novel system for camera-based measurement and visualization of muscle work based on the Hill-Type-Muscle-Model: the exercise exertion muscle-work monitor (\textit{XEM}$^{2}$). Our aim is to complement and, thus, address issues of established measurement techniques that offer imprecise data for non-uniform movements (burned calories) or provide limited information on strain across different body parts (self-perception scales). We validate the reliability of XEM's measurements through a technical evaluation of ten participants and five exercises. Further, we assess the acceptance, usefulness, benefits, and opportunities of \textit{XEM}$^{2}$ in an empirical user study. Our results show that \textit{XEM}$^{2}$ provides reliable values of muscle work and supports participants in understanding their workout while also providing reliable information about perceived exertion per muscle group. With this paper, we introduce a novel system capable of measuring and visualizing exertion for single muscle groups, which has the potential to improve exercise monitoring to prevent unbalanced workouts.

Abstract: Prompting is central to interaction with AI systems, yet many users struggle to explore alternative directions, articulate creative intent, or understand how variations in prompts shape model outputs. We introduce prompt recommender systems (PRS) as an interaction approach that supports exploration, suggesting contextually relevant follow-up prompts. We present PromptHelper, a PRS prototype integrated into an AI chatbot that surfaces semantically diverse prompt suggestions while users work on real writing tasks. We evaluate PromptHelper in a 2x2 fully within-subjects study (N=32) across creative and academic writing tasks. Results show that PromptHelper significantly increases users' perceived exploration and expressiveness without increasing cognitive workload. Qualitative findings illustrate how prompt recommendations help users branch into new directions, overcome uncertainty about what to ask next, and better articulate their intent. We discuss implications for designing AI interfaces that scaffold exploratory interaction while preserving user agency, and release open-source resources to support research on prompt recommendation.

Abstract: Job interview anxiety is a prevalent challenge among university students and can undermine both performance and confidence in high-stakes evaluative situations. Social robots have shown promise in reducing anxiety through emotional support, yet how such systems should balance psychological safety with effective instructional guidance remains an open question. In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative. Quantitative measures further showed significant reductions in interview-related social and communication anxiety, while maintaining high perceived warmth and therapeutic alliance. We synthesize these findings into an Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem framework, highlighting user agency as a key mechanism for balancing emotional support and instructional guidance in social robot coaching systems.

Abstract: In traditional journaling practices, authors express and process their thoughts by writing them down. We propose a somaesthetic-inspired alternative that uses the human body, rather than written words, as the medium of expression. We coin this embodied journaling, as people's isolated body movements and spoken words become the canvas of reflection. We implemented embodied journaling in virtual reality and conducted a within-subject user study (n=20) to explore the emergent behaviours from the process and to compare its expressive and reflective qualities to those of written journaling. When writing-based norms and affordances were absent, we found that participants defaulted towards unfiltered emotional expression, often forgoing words altogether. Rather, subconscious body motion and paralinguistic acoustic qualities unveiled deeper, sometimes hidden feelings, prompting reflection that happens after emotional expression rather than during it. We discuss both the capabilities and pitfalls of embodied journaling, ultimately challenging the idea that reflection culminates in linguistic reasoning.

Abstract: Designing inclusive cycling infrastructure requires balancing competing needs of diverse user groups, yet designers often struggle to anticipate how different cyclists experience the same street. We investigate how persona-based multi-agent evaluation can support inclusive design by making experiential conflicts explicit. We present StreetDesignAI, an interactive system that enables designers to (1) ground evaluation in street context through imagery and map data, (2) receive parallel feedback from cyclist personas spanning confident to cautious users, and (3) iteratively modify designs while surfacing conflicts across perspectives. A within-subjects study with 26 transportation professionals demonstrates that structured multi-perspective feedback significantly improves designers' understanding of diverse user perspectives, ability to identify persona needs, and confidence in translating them into design decisions, with higher satisfaction and stronger intention for professional adoption. Qualitative findings reveal how conflict surfacing transforms design exploration from single-perspective optimization toward deliberate trade-off reasoning. We discuss implications for AI tools that scaffold inclusive design through disagreement as an interaction primitive.

Abstract: Simulated user agents are increasingly used in usability testing to support fast, iterative UX workflows, as they generate rich data such as action logs and think-aloud reasoning, but the unstructured nature of this output often obscures actionable insights. We present UXCascade, an interactive tool for extracting, aggregating, and presenting agent-generated usability feedback at scale. Our core contribution is a multi-level analysis workflow that (1) highlights patterns across persona traits, goals, and outcomes, (2) links agent reasoning to specific issues, and (3) supports actionable design improvements. UXCascade operationalizes this approach by listing agent goals, traits, and issues in a structured overview. Practitioners can explore detailed reasoning traces and annotated views, propose interface edits, and assess their impact across personas. This enables a top-down, exploration-driven analysis from patterns to concrete UX interventions. A user study with eight UX professionals demonstrates that UXCascade integrates into existing workflows, enabling iterative feedback during early-stage interface development.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Bio-digital systems that merge microbial life with technology promise new modes of computation, combining biological adaptability with digital precision. Yet realizing this potential symbiotically -- where biological and digital agents co-adapt and co-process -- remains elusive, largely due to the absence of a shared vocabulary bridging biology and computing. Consequently, microbes are often constrained to uni-directional roles, functioning as sensors or actuators rather than as active, computational partners in bio-digital systems. In response, we propose a taxonomy and pathways that articulate and expand the roles of biological and digital entities for synergetic bio-digital computation. Using this taxonomy, we analysed 70 systems across HCI, design, and engineering, identifying how biological mechanisms can be mapped onto computational abstractions. We argue that such mappings enable computationally actionable directions that foster richer and reciprocal relationships in bio-digital systems, supporting regenerative ecologies across time and scale while inspiring new paradigms for computation in HCI.

Abstract: As AI systems become embedded in everyday practice, value misalignment has emerged as a pressing concern. Yet, dominant alignment approaches remain model centric, treating users as passive recipients of prespecified values rather than as epistemic agents who encounter and respond to misalignment during interactions. Drawing on situated perspectives, we frame alignment as an interactional practice co-constructed during human AI interaction. We investigate how users understand and wish to contribute to this process through a participatory workshop that combines misalignment diaries with generative design activities. We surface how misalignments materialise in practice and how users envision acting on them, grounded in the context of researchers using Large Language Models as research assistants. Our findings show that misalignments are experienced less as abstract ethical violations than as unexpected responses, and task or social breakdowns. Participants articulated roles ranging from adjusting and interpreting model behaviour to deliberate non-engagement as an alignment strategy. We conclude with implications for designing systems that support alignment as an ongoing, situated, and shared practice.

Abstract: How do individuals recover from cybercrimes? Victims experience various types of harm after cybercrimes, including monetary loss, data breaches, negative emotions, and even psychological trauma. The aspects that support their recovery process and contribute to individual cyber resilience remain underinvestigated. To address this gap, we interviewed 18 cybercrime victims from Western Europe using a trauma-informed approach. We identified four common stages following victimization: recognition, coping, processing, and recovery. Participants adopted various strategies to mitigate the impact of cybercrime and used different indicators to describe recovery. While they mostly relied on social support and self-regulation for emotional coping, service providers largely determined whether victims were able to recover their money. Internal factors, external support, and context sensitivity collectively contribute to individuals' cyber resilience. We recommend trauma-informed support for cybercrime victims. Extending our conceptualization of individual cyber resilience, we propose collaborative and context-sensitive strategies to address the harmful impacts of cybercrime.

Abstract: Motivated reasoning -- the idea that individuals processing information may be motivated to reach a certain conclusion, whether it be accurate or predetermined -- has been well-explored as a human phenomenon. However, it is unclear whether base LLMs mimic these motivational changes. Replicating 4 prior political motivated reasoning studies, we find that base LLM behavior does not align with expected human behavior. Furthermore, base LLM behavior across models shares some similarities, such as smaller standard deviations and inaccurate argument strength assessments. We emphasize the importance of these findings for researchers using LLMs to automate tasks such as survey data collection and argument assessment.

Abstract: Online encyclopedias are central to contemporary information infrastructures and have become focal points of debates over ideological bias. Wikipedia, in particular, has long been accused of left-leaning bias, while Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia launched by xAI, has been framed as a right-leaning alternative. This paper presents a comparative analysis of Wikipedia and Grokipedia on well-established politically contested topics. Specifically, we examine differences in semantic framing, political orientation, and content prioritization. We find that semantic similarity between the two platforms decays across article sections and diverges more strongly on controversial topics than on randomly sampled ones. Additionally, we show that both encyclopedias predominantly exhibit left-leaning framings, although Grokipedia exhibits a more bimodal distribution with increased prominence of right-leaning content. The experimental code is publicly available.

Abstract: We develop a two-stage retrieval system that combines multiple complementary retrieval methods with a learned reranker and LLM-based reranking, to address the TREC Tip-of-the-Tongue (ToT) task. In the first stage, we employ hybrid retrieval that merges LLM-based retrieval, sparse (BM25), and dense (BGE-M3) retrieval methods. We also introduce topic-aware multi-index dense retrieval that partitions the Wikipedia corpus into 24 topical domains. In the second stage, we evaluate both a trained LambdaMART reranker and LLM-based reranking. To support model training, we generate 5000 synthetic ToT queries using LLMs. Our best system achieves recall of 0.66 and NDCG@1000 of 0.41 on the test set by combining hybrid retrieval with Gemini-2.5-flash reranking, demonstrating the effectiveness of fusion retrieval.

Abstract: As 6G networks evolve, spectrum assets require flexible, dynamic, and efficient utilization, motivating blockchain based spectrum securitization. Existing approaches based on ERC404 style hybrid token models rely on frequent minting and burning during asset transfers, which disrupt token identity continuity and increase on chain overhead. This paper proposes the Semi Fungible Token Lock (SFT Lock) method, a lock/unlock based mechanism that preserves NFT identity and historical traceability while enabling fractional ownership and transferability. By replacing mint/burn operations with deterministic state transitions, SFT Lock ensures consistent lifecycle representation of spectrum assets and significantly reduces on chain operations. Based on this mechanism, a modular smart contract architecture is designed to support spectrum authorization, securitization, and sharing, and a staking mechanism is introduced to enhance asset liquidity. Experimental results on a private Ethereum network demonstrate that, compared with ERC404 style hybrid token models, the proposed method achieves substantial gas savings while maintaining functional correctness and traceability.

Abstract: Contemporary sequential recommendation methods are becoming more complex, shifting from classification to a diffusion-guided generative paradigm. However, the quality of guidance in the form of user information is often compromised by missing data in the observed sequences, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Existing methods address this by removing locally similar items, but overlook ``critical turning points'' in user interest, which are crucial for accurately predicting subsequent user intent. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Attention Regulation Diffusion model (CARD), which focuses on amplifying the signal from key interest-turning-point items while concurrently identifying and suppressing noise within the user sequence. CARD consists of (1) a Dual-side Thompson Sampling method to identify sequences undergoing significant interest shift, and (2) a counterfactual attention mechanism for these sequences to quantify the importance of each item. In this manner, CARD provides the diffusion model with a high-quality guidance signal composed of dynamically re-weighted interaction vectors to enable effective generation. Experiments show our method works well on real-world data without being computationally expensive. Our code is available at https://github.com/yanqilong3321/CARD.

Abstract: Understanding what users like is relatively straightforward; understanding what users dislike, however, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query-table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval. Our code is available at https://github.com/yumeow0122/CGPT.

Abstract: Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation. Our code is available at https://github.com/adsl135789/STAR.

Abstract: Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Short-video applications have attracted substantial user traffic. However, these platforms also foster problematic usage patterns, commonly referred to as short-video addiction, which pose risks to both user health and the sustainable development of platforms. Prior studies on this issue have primarily relied on questionnaires or volunteer-based data collection, which are often limited by small sample sizes and population biases. In contrast, short-video platforms have large-scale behavioral data, offering a valuable foundation for analyzing addictive behaviors. To examine addiction-aware behavior patterns, we combine economic addiction theory with users' implicit behavior captured by recommendation systems. Our analysis shows that short-video addiction follows functional patterns similar to traditional forms of addictive behavior (e.g., substance abuse) and that its intensity is consistent with findings from previous social science studies. To develop a simulator that can learn and model these patterns, we introduce a novel training framework, AddictSim. To consider the personalized addiction patterns, AddictSim uses a mean-to-adapted strategy with group relative policy optimization training. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that AddictSim consistently outperforms existing training strategies. Our simulation results show that integrating diversity-aware algorithms can mitigate addictive behaviors well.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The computational burden of attention in long-context language models has motivated two largely independent lines of work: sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity by attending to selected tokens, and gated attention variants that improve training sta-bility while mitigating the attention sink phenomenon. We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%. Training stability improves markedly, with loss spikes reduced by 98%.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their integration into clinical decision-making; however, hidden biases against patients across racial, social, economic, and clinical backgrounds persist. In this study, we investigate bias in LLM-based medical AI systems applied to emergency department (ED) triage. We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}. Our results reveal discriminatory behavior mediated through proxy variables in ED triage scenarios, as well as a systematic tendency for LLMs to modify perceived patient severity when specific tokens appear in the input context, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. These findings indicate that AI systems is still imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Consequently, more needs to be done to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in clinical settings.

Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings. This approach fails to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions, leading to "Vector Haze", the retrieval of disjointed facts lacking episodic continuity. We propose Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory not as a static store, but as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 1ms retrieval latency on conversational workloads while ensuring state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Abstract: LLM agents struggle with regulatory audit replay: when asked to reproduce a flagged transaction decision with identical inputs, most deployments fail to return consistent results. This paper introduces the Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness (DFAH), a framework for measuring trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness in tool-using agents deployed in financial services.
  Across 74 configurations (12 models, 4 providers, 8-24 runs each at T=0.0) in non-agentic baseline experiments, 7-20B parameter models achieved 100% determinism, while 120B+ models required 3.7x larger validation samples to achieve equivalent statistical reliability. Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.
  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness. In these benchmarks and under DFAH evaluation settings, Tier 1 models with schema-first architectures achieved determinism levels consistent with audit replay requirements.

Abstract: Adding memory to pretrained language models typically requires architectural changes or weight modification. We present Prometheus Mind, which retrofits memory to a frozen Qwen3-4B using 11 modular adapters (530MB, 7% overhead) -- fully reversible by removing the adapters. Building this system required solving four problems: (1) Extraction -- we develop Contrastive Direction Discovery (CDD), which finds semantic directions via minimal pairs without labeled data. (2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head.weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training. (4) Hidden state collapse -- transformers make ``wife'' and ``brother'' 0.98+ similar; we train projections to recover distinction (0.98 $\rightarrow$ 0.09). On PrometheusExtract-132 (132 cases), the system achieves 94.4% retrieval on clean inputs (n=54, 95% CI: [84.9%, 98.1%]), degrading to 19.4% on informal inputs with ellipsis, filler words, or implicit subjects (n=36). The primary bottleneck is relation classification (47.3% accuracy), responsible for most extraction errors.

Abstract: The rash development of knowledge graph research has brought big driving force to its application in many areas, including the medicine and healthcare domain. However, we have found that the application of some major information processing techniques on knowledge graph still lags behind. This defect includes the failure to make sufficient use of advanced logic reasoning, advanced artificial intelligence techniques, special-purpose programming languages, modern probabilistic and statistic theories et al. on knowledge graphs development and application. In particular, the multiple knowledge graphs cooperation and competition techniques have not got enough attention from researchers. This paper develops a systematic theory, technique and application of the concept 'knowledge graph network' and its application in medical and healthcare domain. Our research covers its definition, development, reasoning, computing and application under different conditions such as unsharp, uncertain, multi-modal, vectorized, distributed, federated. Almost in each case we provide (real data) examples and experiment results. Finally, a conclusion of innovation is provided.

Abstract: Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.

Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.

Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.

Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: The use of Transfer Learning & Transformers has steadily improved accuracy and has significantly contributed in solving complex computation problems. However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.

Abstract: A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.

Abstract: Personalized learning systems have emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes by tailoring educational content, pacing, and feedback to individual needs. However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.

Abstract: Current business environments require organizations to continuously reconfigure cross-functional processes, yet enterprise systems are still organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.

Abstract: Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of human cognitive mechanisms. We introduce CogToM, a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier models like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals significant performance heterogeneities and highlights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimensions. Further analysis based on human cognitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs.

Abstract: Healthcare organizations are beginning to embed agentic AI into routine workflows, including clinical documentation support and early-warning monitoring. As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).
  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy").
  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.

Abstract: The rapid rise of autonomous AI systems and advancements in agent capabilities are introducing new risks due to reduced oversight of real-world interactions. Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.
  To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.
  This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.
  The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their unreliability remains a critical barrier to deployment in high-stakes domains. This survey charts a functional evolution in addressing this challenge: the evolution of uncertainty from a passive diagnostic metric to an active control signal guiding real-time model behavior. We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Although AI agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-horizon reasoning, their reliability is severely hampered by the ``Spiral of Hallucination,'' where early epistemic errors propagate irreversibly. Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.

Abstract: As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.
  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning in the real world remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, sparse rewards, and noisy visual observations. Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI agents are rapidly advancing from passive language models to autonomous systems executing complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.

Abstract: Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.

Abstract: Chronic diseases have become the leading cause of death worldwide, a challenge intensified by strained medical resources and an aging population. Individually, patients often struggle to interpret early signs of deterioration or maintain adherence to care plans. In this paper, we introduce VitalDiagnosis, an LLM-driven ecosystem designed to shift chronic disease management from passive monitoring to proactive, interactive engagement. By integrating continuous data from wearable devices with the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the system addresses both acute health anomalies and routine adherence. It analyzes triggers through context-aware inquiries, produces provisional insights within a collaborative patient-clinician workflow, and offers personalized guidance. This approach aims to promote a more proactive and cooperative care paradigm, with the potential to enhance patient self-management and reduce avoidable clinical workload.

Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.

Abstract: The development of native computer-use agents (CUA) represents a significant leap in multimodal AI. However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.

Abstract: Planetary surfaces are typically analyzed using high-level semantic concepts in natural language, yet vast orbital image archives remain organized at the pixel level. This mismatch limits scalable, open-ended exploration of planetary surfaces. Here we present MarScope, a planetary-scale vision-language framework enabling natural language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms. MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978. Applications further show that it extends beyond morphological classification to facilitate process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at a planetary scale. MarScope establishes a new paradigm where natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets.

Abstract: The Decision Transformer (DT) has established a powerful sequence modeling approach to offline reinforcement learning. It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.

Abstract: The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning. Code is available at https://github.com/Intelligent-molecular-systems/KG-LLM-Synthesis-Retrieval.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) under water stress is critical for monitoring crop productivity, guiding irrigation, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

Abstract: Climate disinformation has become a major challenge in today digital world, especially with the rise of misleading images and videos shared widely on social media. These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.

Abstract: Dynamic community detection plays a crucial role in understanding the temporal evolution of community structures in complex networks. Existing methods based on nonnegative tensor RESCAL decomposition typically require the decomposition rank to equal the number of communities, which limits model flexibility. This paper proposes an improved MLP-enhanced nonnegative tensor decomposition model (MLP-NTD) that incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) after RESCAL decomposition for community mapping, thereby decoupling the decomposition rank from the number of communities. The framework optimizes model parameters through a reconstruction loss function, which preserves the ability to capture dynamic community evolution while significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of community partitioning. Experimental results on multiple real-world dynamic network datasets demonstrate that MLP-NTD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of modularity, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Social media users exhibit diverse behavioral patterns as platforms function simultaneously as information and friendship networks. We introduce a reciprocity-based framework mapping users onto two-dimensional space defined by bidirectional connection ratios. Analyzing 48,830 Twitter users and 149 million connections, we demonstrate that fragmented user types from prior studies (influencers, lurkers, brokers, and follow-back accounts) emerge naturally as regions within continuous behavioral space rather than discrete categories. User properties vary smoothly across the reciprocity dimensions, revealing clear behavioral gradients. This framework provides the first unified model encompassing the full spectrum of social media behaviors and offers interpretable metrics for influence measurement and platform design.

Abstract: In the study of time-dependent (i.e., temporal) networks, researchers often examine the evolution of communities, which are sets of densely connected sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other nodes. An increasingly prominent approach to studying community structure in temporal networks is statistical inference. In the present paper, we study the performance of a class of statistical-inference methods for community detection in temporal networks. We represent temporal networks as multilayer networks, with each layer encoding a time step, and we illustrate that statistical-inference models that generate community assignments via either a uniform distribution on community assignments or discrete-time Markov processes are biased against generating communities with large or small numbers of nodes. In particular, we demonstrate that statistical-inference methods that use such generative models tend to poorly identify community structure in networks with large or small communities. To rectify this issue, we introduce a novel statistical model that generates the community assignments of the nodes in given layer (i.e., at a given time) using all of the community assignments in the previous layer. We prove results that guarantee that our approach greatly mitigates the bias against large and small communities, so using our generative model is beneficial for studying community structure in networks with large or small communities.

Abstract: ``Impression Zombies'', a type of malicious account designed to artificially inflate engagement metrics, have recently emerged as a significant threat on X (formerly Twitter). These accounts disseminate a high volume of low-quality, irrelevant posts, which degrade the user experience. This study aims (1) to quantitatively characterize their behavioral patterns and (2) to develop a method for detecting such accounts. To address the first objective, we collected data from 9,909 accounts and compared the characteristics of Impression Zombies and general users within this dataset. We find that, Impression Zombies post more than three times the average total number of posts per day and tend to gather followers by using phrases such as ``follow back.'' Addressing the second objective, we constructed a classification model for Impression Zombies that leverages the contextual incoherence often observed between parent posts and the replies from Impression Zombies. Experimental results show that our model achieved approximately 92\% accuracy in detecting Impression Zombies. This study provides the first quantitative insights into Impression Zombies and offers a practical framework for detecting such accounts, contributing to platform transparency and the health of social media ecosystems.

Abstract: Now-a-days, Online Social Networks (OSNs) are extensively used by different commercial houses for viral marketing. The key problem that arises in this context is to choose a limited number of highly influential users as the initial adopters of a brand such that the influence regarding the brand in the network gets maximized. Deviating from this standard setting, in this paper, we study the problem where every user of the network is associated with a selection cost and a benefit value. This benefit value can be earned from the user if (s)he is influenced by the brand. A fixed amount of budget is allocated for selecting the seed users. The goal of initial adopters is to choose a set of seed users within the budget such that the profit is maximized. We propose a two phase diffusion model for this problem where the goal is to split the diffusion process into two phases, and hence, split the budget into two halves. First, we spend the first half budget to select seed users for the first phase and observe the diffusion for a few rounds and then deploy the seed users for the second phase and successively complete the diffusion process. We prove several properties of the two phase influence function. Three solution approaches have been proposed for our problem with detailed analysis and illustrative examples. We conduct a number of experiments with three real-world social network datasets. From the experiments, we observe that the two phase diffusion approach leads to more amount of profit compared to the single-phase diffusion. In particular, for most instances, this improvement is greater than 18% and reaching as high as 40% by the proposed methodologies.

Abstract: Social media platforms are often criticized for fostering antisocial behavior rather than prosocial behavior. Yet, testing interventions to encourage prosocial dispositions, such as open-mindedness, has been hindered by researchers' limited ability to manipulate platform features and isolate causal effects in commercial environments. We address this challenge through a randomized controlled trial with 2,282 U.S. adults conducted on a new research platform we developed that uses AI bots to replicate live social media dynamics while enabling controlled experimentation. Participants engaged in 15-minute discussions about energy and climate topics, with treatment groups exposed to curiosity priming either through modified on-platform social norms, interface affordances, or both. Results demonstrate that curiosity priming significantly increased question-asking behavior and textual measures of curiosity in user posts, while also reducing toxicity. Although interventions decreased generic engagement behaviors like liking and commenting, they had no significant negative impact on reported app enjoyment or time spent writing posts and replies. Leveraging experimental control over platform features, our findings suggest that platform designs prioritizing curiosity can promote prosocial behaviors among users without compromising user experience.
