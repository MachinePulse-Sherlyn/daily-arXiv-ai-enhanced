Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models and AI agents across critical societal and technical domains is hindered by persistent behavioral pathologies including sycophancy, hallucination, and strategic deception that resist mitigation via reinforcement learning. Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a "locked-in" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language models exhibit fundamental limitations -- hallucination, brittleness, and lack of formal grounding -- that are particularly problematic in high-stakes specialist fields requiring verifiable reasoning. I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models is increasingly challenging as models improve. Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles. We also find that creating good puzzles is still a highly challenging task for current models, not measured by previous benchmarks. Overall, our work suggests new paradigms for evaluating reasoning that cannot be saturated by design, and that allow testing models for other skills like creativity and task creation alongside problem solving.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate scientific workflows, yet their integration with heterogeneous computational tools remains ad hoc and fragile. Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gráfico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates. Together, these results illustrate how abstraction and type safety can provide a scalable foundation for agentic scientific automation beyond prompt-centric designs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traditional AI alignment primarily focuses on individual model outputs; however, autonomous agents in long-horizon workflows require sustained reliability across entire interaction trajectories. We introduce APEMO (Affect-aware Peak-End Modulation for Orchestration), a runtime scheduling layer that optimizes computational allocation under fixed budgets by operationalizing temporal-affective signals. Instead of modifying model weights, APEMO detects trajectory instability through behavioral proxies and targets repairs at critical segments, such as peak moments and endings. Evaluation across multi-agent simulations and LLM-based planner--executor flows demonstrates that APEMO consistently enhances trajectory-level quality and reuse probability over structural orchestrators. Our results reframe alignment as a temporal control problem, offering a resilient engineering pathway for the development of long-horizon agentic systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based systems increasingly generate structured workflows for complex tasks. In practice, automatic evaluation of these workflows is difficult, because metric scores are often not calibrated, and score changes do not directly communicate the severity of workflow degradation. We introduce WorkflowPerturb, a controlled benchmark for studying workflow evaluation metrics. It works by applying realistic, controlled perturbations to golden workflows. WorkflowPerturb contains 4,973 golden workflows and 44,757 perturbed variants across three perturbation types (Missing Steps, Compressed Steps, and Description Changes), each applied at severity levels of 10%, 30%, and 50%. We benchmark multiple metric families and analyze their sensitivity and calibration using expected score trajectories and residuals. Our results characterize systematic differences across metric families and support severity-aware interpretation of workflow evaluation scores. Our dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scalable robot policy pre-training has been hindered by the high cost of collecting high-quality demonstrations for each platform. In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unsupervised representations are widely assumed to be neutral with respect to sensitive attributes when those attributes are withheld from training. We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines. We have made the code available at~ https://github.com/JosephBingham/SOMtime

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a prominent framework for efficient agent coordination. Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \underline{O}nline off-policy \underline{MA}RL framework using \underline{D}iffusion policies (\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination. Extensive evaluations on MPE and MAMuJoCo establish our method as the new state-of-the-art across $10$ diverse tasks, demonstrating a remarkable $2.5\times$ to $5\times$ improvement in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: User devices are the largest contributor to media related global emissions. For web content, dark mode has been widely recommended as an energy-saving measure for certain display types. However, the energy savings achieved by dark mode may be undermined by user behaviour. This pilot study investigates the unintended consequences of dark mode adoption, revealing a rebound effect wherein users may increase display brightness when interacting with dark-themed web pages. This behaviour may negate the potential energy savings that dark mode offers. Our findings suggest that the energy efficiency benefits of dark mode are not as straightforward as commonly believed for display energy, and the interplay between content colourscheme and user behaviour must be carefully considered in sustainability guidelines and interventions.

Abstract: As students increasingly rely on large language models, hallucinations pose a growing threat to learning. To mitigate this, AI literacy must expand beyond prompt engineering to address how students should detect and respond to LLM hallucinations. To support this, we need to understand how students experience hallucinations, how they detect them, and why they believe they occur. To investigate these questions, we asked university students three open-ended questions about their experiences with AI hallucinations, their detection strategies, and their mental models of why hallucinations occur. Sixty-three students responded to the survey. Thematic analysis of their responses revealed that reported hallucination issues primarily relate to incorrect or fabricated citations, false information, overconfident but misleading responses, poor adherence to prompts, persistence in incorrect answers, and sycophancy. To detect hallucinations, students rely either on intuitive judgment or on active verification strategies, such as cross-checking with external sources or re-prompting the model. Students' explanations for why hallucinations occur reflected several mental models, including notable misconceptions. Many described AI as a research engine that fabricates information when it cannot locate an answer in its "database." Others attributed hallucinations to issues with training data, inadequate prompting, or the model's inability to understand or verify information. These findings illuminate vulnerabilities in AI-supported learning and highlight the need for explicit instruction in verification protocols, accurate mental models of generative AI, and awareness of behaviors such as sycophancy and confident delivery that obscure inaccuracy. The study contributes empirical evidence for integrating hallucination awareness and mitigation into AI literacy curricula.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Technology-facilitated abuse (TFA) is a pervasive form of intimate partner violence (IPV) that leverages digital tools to control, surveil, or harm survivors. While tech clinics are one of the reliable sources of support for TFA survivors, they face limitations due to staffing constraints and logistical barriers. As a result, many survivors turn to online resources for assistance. With the growing accessibility and popularity of large language models (LLMs), and increasing interest from IPV organizations, survivors may begin to consult LLM-based chatbots before seeking help from tech clinics.
  In this work, we present the first expert-led manual evaluation of four LLMs - two widely used general-purpose non-reasoning models and two domain-specific models designed for IPV contexts - focused on their effectiveness in responding to TFA-related questions. Using real-world questions collected from literature and online forums, we assess the quality of zero-shot single-turn LLM responses generated with a survivor safety-centered prompt on criteria tailored to the TFA domain. Additionally, we conducted a user study to evaluate the perceived actionability of these responses from the perspective of individuals who have experienced TFA.
  Our findings, grounded in both expert assessment and user feedback, provide insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the TFA context and may inform the design, development, and fine-tuning of future models for this domain. We conclude with concrete recommendations to improve LLM performance for survivor support.

Abstract: This research explores the role of digital self-efficacy in the appropriation of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) by higher education faculty. Drawing on Bandura's sociocognitive theory and Flichy's concept of usage framework, our study examines the relationships between levels of digital self-efficacy and GAI usage profiles. A survey of 265 faculty members identified three user profiles (Engaged, Reflective Reserved, Critical Resisters) and validated a three-dimensional digital self-efficacy scale. Results reveal a significant association between self-efficacy profiles and GAI appropriation patterns. Based on these findings, we propose a differentiated usage framework integrating four sociotechnical configurations, appropriation trajectories adapted to self-efficacy profiles, and personalized institutional support mechanisms.

Abstract: When AI systems summarize and relay information, they inevitably transform it. But how? We introduce an experimental paradigm based on the telephone game to study what happens when AI talks to AI. Across five studies tracking content through AI transmission chains, we find three consistent patterns. The first is convergence, where texts differing in certainty, emotional intensity, and perspectival balance collapse toward a shared default of moderate confidence, muted affect, and analytical structure. The second is selective survival, where narrative anchors persist while the texture of evidence, hedges, quotes, and attributions is stripped away. The third is competitive filtering, where strong arguments survive while weaker but valid considerations disappear when multiple viewpoints coexist. In downstream experiments, human participants rated AI-transmitted content as more credible and polished. Importantly, however, humans also showed degraded factual recall, reduced perception of balance, and diminished emotional resonance. We show that the properties that make AI-mediated content appear authoritative may systematically erode the cognitive and affective diversity on which informed judgment depends.

Abstract: Conversational agents increasingly mediate everyday digital interactions, yet the effects of their communication style on user experience and task success remain unclear. Addressing this gap, we describe the results of a between-subject user study where participants interact with one of two versions of a chatbot called NAVI which assists users in an interactive map-based 2D navigation task. The two chatbot versions differ only in communication style: one is friendly and supportive, while the other is direct and task-focused. Our results show that the friendly style increases subjective satisfaction and significantly improves task completion rates among female participants only, while no baseline differences between female and male participants were observed in a control condition without the chatbot. Furthermore, we find little evidence of users mimicking the chatbot's style, suggesting limited linguistic accommodation. These findings highlight the importance of user- and task-sensitive conversational agents and support that communication style personalization can meaningfully enhance interaction quality and performance.

Abstract: Collaborative problem-solving under time pressure is common but difficult, as teams must generate ideas quickly, coordinate actions, and track progress. Generative AI offers new opportunities to assist, but we know little about how proactive agents affect the dynamics of real-time, co-located teamwork. We studied two forms of proactive support in digital escape rooms: a facilitator agent that offered summaries and group structures, and a peer agent that proposed ideas and answered queries. In a within-subjects study with 24 participants, we compared group performance and processes across three conditions: no AI, peer, and facilitator. Results show that the peer agent occasionally enhanced problem-solving by offering timely hints and memory support; however, it also disrupted flow, increased workload, and created over-reliance. In comparison, the facilitator agent provided light scaffolding but had a limited impact on outcomes. We provide design considerations for proactive generative AI agents based on our findings.

Abstract: Maintaining and refactoring React web applications is challenging, as React code often becomes complex due to its core API called Hooks. For example, Hooks often lead developers to create complex dependencies among components, making code behavior unpredictable and reducing maintainability, i.e., anti-patterns. To address this challenge, we present HookLens, an interactive visual analytics system that helps developers understand howHooks define dependencies and data flows between components. Informed by an iterative design process with experienced React developers, HookLens supports users to efficiently understand the structure and dependencies between components and to identify anti-patterns. A quantitative user study with 12 React developers demonstrates that HookLens significantly improves participants' accuracy in detecting anti-patterns compared to conventional code editors. Moreover, a comparative study with state-of-the-art LLM-based coding assistants confirms that these improvements even surpass the capabilities of such coding assistants on the same task.

Abstract: Interactive systems such as chatbots and games are increasingly used to persuade and educate on sustainability-related topics, yet it remains unclear how different delivery formats shape learning and persuasive outcomes when content is held constant. Grounding on identical arguments and factual content across conditions, we present a controlled user study comparing three modes of information delivery: static essays, conversational chatbots, and narrative text-based games. Across subjective measures, the chatbot condition consistently outperformed the other modes and increased perceived importance of the topic. However, perceived learning did not reliably align with objective outcomes: participants in the text-based game condition reported learning less than those reading essays, yet achieved higher scores on a delayed (24-hour) knowledge quiz. Additional exploratory analyses further suggest that common engagement proxies, such as verbosity and interaction length, are more closely related to subjective experience than to actual learning. These findings highlight a dissociation between how persuasive experiences feel and what participants retain, and point to important design trade-offs between interactivity, realism, and learning in persuasive systems and serious games.

Abstract: Children with chronic conditions face evolving challenges in daily activities, peer relationships, and clinical care. Younger children often rely on parental support, while older ones seek independence. Prior studies on chronic conditions explored proxy-based, family-centered, and playful approaches to support children's health, but most technologies treat children as a homogeneous group rather than adapting to their developmental differences. To address this gap, we conducted four co-design workshops with 69 children with congenital heart disease (CHD) at a medically supported camp, spanning elementary, middle, and high school groups. Our analysis reveals distinct coping strategies: elementary children relied on comfort objects and reassurance, middle schoolers used mediated communication and selective disclosure, and high schoolers emphasized agency and direct engagement with peers and providers. Through child-centered participatory design, we contribute empirical insights into how children's management of chronic conditions evolves and propose design implications for pediatric health technologies that adapt across developmental trajectories.

Abstract: While accessibility (a11y) guidelines exist for 3D games and virtual worlds, their applicability to extended reality (XR)'s unique interaction paradigms (e.g., spatial tracking, kinesthetic interactions) remains unexplored. XR practitioners need practical guidance to successfully implement a11y guidelines under real-world constraints. We present the first evaluation of existing 3D a11y guidelines applied to XR development through semi-structured interviews with 25 XR practitioners across diverse organization contexts. We assessed 20 commonly-agreed a11y guidelines from six major resources across visual, motor, cognitive, speech, and hearing domains, comparing practitioners' development practices against guideline applicability to XR. Our investigation reveals that guidelines can be highly effective when designed as transformation catalysts rather than compliance checklists, but fundamental mismatches exist between existing 3D guidelines and XR requirements, creating both implementation barriers and design gaps. This work provides foundational insights towards developing a11y guidelines and support tools that address XR's distinct characteristics.

Abstract: DuoTouch is a passive attachment for capacitive touch panels that adds tangible input while minimizing content occlusion and loss of input area. It uses two contact footprints and two traces to encode motion as binary sequences and runs on unmodified devices through standard touch APIs. We present two configurations with paired decoders: an aligned configuration that maps fixed-length codes to discrete commands and a phase-shifted configuration that estimates direction and distance from relative timing. To characterize the system's reliability, we derive a sampling-limited bound that links actuation speed, internal trace width, and device touch sampling rate. Through technical evaluations on a smartphone and a touchpad, we report performance metrics that describe the relationship between these parameters and decoding accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of DuoTouch by embedding the mechanism into various form factors, including a hand strap, a phone ring holder, and touchpad add-ons.

Abstract: Academic advising in higher education is under severe strain, with advisor-to-student ratios commonly exceeding 300:1. These structural bottlenecks limit timely access to guidance, increase the risk of delayed graduation, and contribute to inequities in student support. We introduce Aurora, a modular neuro-symbolic advising agent that unifies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), symbolic reasoning, and normalized curricular databases to deliver policy-compliant, verifiable recommendations at scale. Aurora integrates three components: (i) a Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) catalog schema for consistent program rules, (ii) a Prolog engine for prerequisite and credit enforcement, and (iii) an instruction-tuned large language model for natural-language explanations of its recommendations. To assess performance, we design a structured evaluation suite spanning common and edge-case advising scenarios, including short-term scheduling, long-term roadmapping, skill-aligned pathways, and out-of-scope requests. Across this diverse set, Aurora improves semantic alignment with expert-crafted answers from 0.68 (Raw LLM baseline) to 0.93 (+36%), achieves perfect precision and recall in nearly half of in-scope cases, and consistently produces correct fallbacks for unanswerable prompts. On commodity hardware, Aurora delivers sub-second mean latency (0.71s across 20 queries), approximately 83X faster than a Raw LLM baseline (59.2s). By combining symbolic rigor with neural fluency, Aurora advances a paradigm for accurate, explainable, and scalable AI-driven advising.

Abstract: Qualitative data analysis is labor-intensive, yet the privacy risks associated with commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) often preclude their use in sensitive research. To address this, we introduce ChatQDA, an on-device framework powered by open-source LLMs designed for privacy-preserving open coding. Our mixed-methods user study reveals that while participants rated the system highly for usability and perceived efficiency, they exhibited "conditional trust", valuing the tool for surface-level extraction while questioning its interpretive nuance and consistency. Furthermore, despite the technical security of local deployment, participants reported epistemic uncertainty regarding data protection, suggesting that invisible security measures are insufficient to foster trust. We conclude with design recommendations for local-first analysis tools that prioritize verifiable privacy and methodological rigor.

Abstract: Providing scaffolding through educational chatbots built on Large Language Models (LLM) has potential risks and benefits that remain an open area of research. When students navigate impasses, they ask for help by formulating impasse-driven questions. Within interactions with LLM chatbots, such questions shape the user prompts and drive the pedagogical effectiveness of the chatbot's response. This paper focuses on such student questions from two datasets of distinct learning contexts: formative self-study, and summative assessed coursework. We analysed 6,113 messages from both learning contexts, using 11 different LLMs and three human raters to classify student questions using four existing schemas. On the feasibility of using LLMs as raters, results showed moderate-to-good inter-rater reliability, with higher consistency than human raters. The data showed that 'procedural' questions predominated in both learning contexts, but more so when students prepare for summative assessment. These results provide a basis on which to use LLMs for classification of student questions. However, we identify clear limitations in both the ability to classify with schemas and the value of doing so: schemas are limited and thus struggle to accommodate the semantic richness of composite prompts, offering only partial understanding the wider risks and benefits of chatbot integration. In the future, we recommend an analysis approach that captures the nuanced, multi-turn nature of conversation, for example, by applying methods from conversation analysis in discursive psychology.

Abstract: Alignment research on large language models (LLMs) increasingly depends on understanding how these systems are used in everyday contexts. yet naturalistic interaction data is difficult to access due to privacy constraints and platform control. We present AI-Wrapped, a prototype workflow for collecting naturalistic LLM usage data while providing participants with an immediate ``wrapped''-style report on their usage statistics, top topics, and safety-relevant behavioral patterns. We report findings from an initial deployment with 82 U.S.-based adults across 48,495 conversations from their 2025 histories. Participants used LLMs for both instrumental and reflective purposes, including creative work, professional tasks, and emotional or existential themes. Some usage patterns were consistent with potential over-reliance or perfectionistic refinement, while heavier users showed comparatively more reflective exchanges than primarily transactional ones. Methodologically, even with zero data retention and PII removal, participants may remain hesitant to share chat data due to perceived privacy and judgment risks, underscoring the importance of trust, agency, and transparent design when building measurement infrastructure for alignment research.

Abstract: In video search systems, user historical behaviors provide rich context for identifying search intent and resolving ambiguity. However, traditional methods utilizing implicit history features often suffer from signal dilution and delayed feedback. To address these challenges, we propose WeWrite, a novel Personalized Demand-aware Query Rewriting framework. Specifically, WeWrite tackles three key challenges: (1) When to Write: An automated posterior-based mining strategy extracts high-quality samples from user logs, identifying scenarios where personalization is strictly necessary; (2) How to Write: A hybrid training paradigm combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to align the LLM's output style with the retrieval system; (3) Deployment: A parallel "Fake Recall" architecture ensures low latency. Online A/B testing on a large-scale video platform demonstrates that WeWrite improves the Click-Through Video Volume (VV$>$10s) by 1.07% and reduces the Query Reformulation Rate by 2.97%.

Abstract: AI systems have achieved remarkable success in processing text and relational data, yet visual document processing remains relatively underexplored. Whereas traditional systems require OCR transcriptions to convert these visual documents into text and metadata, recent advances in multimodal foundation models offer retrieval and generation directly from document images. This raises a key question: How do image-based systems compare to established text-based methods? We introduce IRPAPERS, a benchmark of 3,230 pages from 166 scientific papers, with both an image and an OCR transcription for each page. Using 180 needle-in-the-haystack questions, we compare image- and text-based retrieval and question answering systems. Text retrieval using Arctic 2.0 embeddings, BM25, and hybrid text search achieved 46% Recall@1, 78% Recall@5, and 91% Recall@20, while image-based retrieval reaches 43%, 78%, and 93%, respectively. The two modalities exhibit complementary failures, enabling multimodal hybrid search to outperform either alone, achieving 49% Recall@1, 81% Recall@5, and 95% Recall@20. We further evaluate efficiency-performance tradeoffs with MUVERA and assess multiple multi-vector image embedding models. Among closed-source models, Cohere Embed v4 page image embeddings outperform Voyage 3 Large text embeddings and all tested open-source models, achieving 58% Recall@1, 87% Recall@5, and 97% Recall@20. For question answering, text-based RAG systems achieved higher ground-truth alignment than image-based systems (0.82 vs. 0.71), and both benefit substantially from increased retrieval depth, with multi-document retrieval outperforming oracle single-document retrieval. We analyze the complementary limitations of unimodal text and image representations and identify question types that require one modality over the other. The IRPAPERS dataset and all experimental code are publicly available.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of scientific literature chatbots through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with a focus on evaluating vector- and graph-based retrieval systems. The proposed chatbot leverages both structured (graph) and unstructured (vector) databases to access scientific articles and gray literature, enabling efficient triage of sources according to research objectives. To systematically assess performance, we examine two use-case scenarios: retrieval from a single uploaded document and retrieval from a large-scale corpus. Benchmark test sets were generated using a GPT model, with selected outputs annotated for evaluation. The comparative analysis emphasizes retrieval accuracy and response relevance, providing insight into the strengths and limitations of each approach. The findings demonstrate the potential of hybrid RAG systems to improve accessibility to scientific knowledge and to support evidence-based decision making.

Abstract: Information retrieval evaluation often suffers from fragmented practices -- varying dataset subsets, aggregation methods, and pipeline configurations -- that undermine reproducibility and comparability, especially for foundation embedding models requiring robust out-of-domain performance. We introduce SuiteEval, a unified framework that offers automatic end-to-end evaluation, dynamic indexing that reuses on-disk indices to minimise disk usage, and built-in support for major benchmarks (BEIR, LoTTE, MS MARCO, NanoBEIR, and BRIGHT). Users only need to supply a pipeline generator. SuiteEval handles data loading, indexing, ranking, metric computation, and result aggregation. New benchmark suites can be added in a single line. SuiteEval reduces boilerplate and standardises evaluations to facilitate reproducible IR research, as a broader benchmark set is increasingly required.

Abstract: Most implicit collaborative filtering (CF) models are trained with negative sampling, where existing work designs sophisticated strategies for high-quality negatives while largely overlooking the exploration of positive samples. Although some denoising recommendation methods can be applied to implicit CF for denoising positive samples, they often sparsify positive supervision. Moreover, these approaches generally overlook user activity bias during training, leading to insufficient learning for inactive users. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective negative sampling plugin, PSP-NS, from the perspective of enhancing positive supervision signals. It builds a user-item bipartite graph with edge weights indicating interaction confidence inferred from global and local patterns, generates positive sample pairs via replication-based reweighting to strengthen positive signals, and adopts an activity-aware weighting scheme to effectively learn inactive users' preferences. We provide theoretical insights from a margin-improvement perspective, explaining why PSP-NS tends to improve ranking quality (e.g., Precision@k/Recall@k), and conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to demonstrate its superiority. For instance, PSP-NS boosts Recall@30 and Precision@30 by 32.11% and 22.90% on Yelp over the strongest baselines. PSP-NS can be integrated with various implicit CF recommenders or negative sampling methods to enhance their performance.

Abstract: Socks are produced and replaced at a massive scale, yet their paired use makes them unusually vulnerable to waste, as the loss of a single sock can strand usable wear-capacity and trigger premature replacement. In this study, we quantify the economic and ecological value of pairing non-matching \say{orphan} socks, and the social cost that discourages this behaviour. We formalize sock ownership as a sequential decision problem under uncertainty in which socks wear out and disappear stochastically during laundering, while public exposure induces a person-specific mismatch penalty. We conducted an in-person study to estimate mismatch sensitivity and diversity preference, linking behavioural heterogeneity to optimal mixing strategies. Using these results and a computer simulation-based evaluation of interpretable pairing policies, we show that strict matching can appear resource-frugal largely because it generates many sockless days, whereas controlled tolerance for mismatch sustains service and reduces stranded capacity across loss regimes. This study establishes the feasibility of matching non-matching socks while outlining its limitations and challenges.

Abstract: Negative sampling is a pivotal technique in implicit collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation, enabling efficient and effective training by contrasting observed interactions with sampled unobserved ones.
  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in recommender systems; however, research on LLM-empowered negative sampling remains underexplored.
  Existing methods heavily rely on textual information and task-specific fine-tuning, limiting practical applicability.
  To address this limitation, we propose a text-free and fine-tuning-free Dual-Tree LLM-enhanced Negative Sampling method (DTL-NS).
  It consists of two modules: (i) an offline false negative identification module that leverages hierarchical index trees to transform collaborative structural and latent semantic information into structured item-ID encodings for LLM inference, enabling accurate identification of false negatives; and (ii) a multi-view hard negative sampling module that combines user-item preference scores with item-item hierarchical similarities from these encodings to mine high-quality hard negatives, thus improving models' discriminative ability.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DTL-NS. For example, on the Amazon-sports dataset, DTL-NS outperforms the strongest baseline by 10.64% and 19.12% in Recall@20 and NDCG@20, respectively.
  Moreover, DTL-NS can be integrated into various implicit CF models and negative sampling methods, consistently enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Modeling long sequences of user behaviors has emerged as a critical frontier in generative recommendation. However, existing solutions face a dilemma: linear attention mechanisms achieve efficiency at the cost of retrieval precision due to limited state capacity, while softmax attention suffers from prohibitive computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HyTRec, a model featuring a Hybrid Attention architecture that explicitly decouples long-term stable preferences from short-term intent spikes. By assigning massive historical sequences to a linear attention branch and reserving a specialized softmax attention branch for recent interactions, our approach restores precise retrieval capabilities within industrial-scale contexts involving ten thousand interactions. To mitigate the lag in capturing rapid interest drifts within the linear layers, we furthermore design Temporal-Aware Delta Network (TADN) to dynamically upweight fresh behavioral signals while effectively suppressing historical noise. Empirical results on industrial-scale datasets confirm the superiority that our model maintains linear inference speed and outperforms strong baselines, notably delivering over 8% improvement in Hit Rate for users with ultra-long sequences with great efficiency.

Abstract: Negative sampling strategies are widely used in implicit collaborative filtering to address issues like data sparsity and class imbalance. However, these methods often introduce false negatives, hindering the model's ability to accurately learn users' latent preferences. To mitigate this problem, existing methods adjust the negative sampling distribution based on statistical features from model training or the hardness of negative samples. Nevertheless, these methods face two key limitations: (1) over-reliance on the model's current representation capabilities; (2) failure to leverage the potential of false negatives as latent positive samples to guide model learning of user preferences more accurately. To address the above issues, we propose a Topology-aware Positive Sample Set Construction and Feature Optimization method (TPSC-FO). First, we design a simple topological community-aware false negative identification (FNI) method and observe that topological community structures in interaction networks can effectively identify false negatives. Motivated by this, we develop a topology-aware positive sample set construction module. This module employs a differential community detection strategy to capture topological community structures in implicit feedback, coupled with personalized noise filtration to reliably identify false negatives and convert them into positive samples. Additionally, we introduce a neighborhood-guided feature optimization module that refines positive sample features by incorporating neighborhood features in the embedding space, effectively mitigating noise in the positive samples. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets and two synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of TPSC-FO.

Abstract: The diffusion of complex opinions is severely hindered in multilayer social networks by echo chambers and cognitive consistency mechanisms. We investigate Influence Maximization strategies within the 3-state multilayer q-voter model. Utilizing the mABCD benchmark, we simulate social environments ranging from integrated Open Worlds to segregated Fortress Worlds. Our results reveal a topological paradox that we term the "Fortress Trap". In highly modular networks, strategies maximizing local density such as Clique Influence Maximization (CIM) and k-Shell fail to trigger global cascades, creating isolated bunkers of consensus due to the Overkill Effect. Furthermore, we identify a Redundancy Trap in perfectly aligned Clan topologies, where the structural overlap of layers creates a "Perfect Prison," rendering it the most resistant environment to diffusion. We demonstrate that VoteRank, a strategy that prioritizes diversity of reach over local intensity, consistently outperforms structure-based methods. These findings suggest that, for complex contagion, maximizing topological entropy is more effective than reinforcing local clusters.
